Chapter 7</b></p>

<p>
Curly and I went uptown, engaged a room, and bathed.
After lunch he asked me if I had ever visited the &quot;Chicken Soup
Springs&quot; on the outskirts of town. I thought he was kidding, and replied
that the feathers tickled my throat. He assured me that it was true, and though
I didn't believe him I accompanied him to Bock's Hot Springs, where we drank
several cupfuls of the so-called chicken soup. We seasoned it with salt and
pepper. The water had a mild chicken-like flavor, and I am sure that if it had
been served as chicken consomm‰ in a restaurant, well-seasoned and piping hot,
no complaint would have been made.</p>

<p>
When we returned
to our room, Curly told me of his wanderings since the Fort Wayne affair. He
had kept in the background because of his regard for my parents and my own
welfare; but when he learned of my trouble in Denver he concluded that I would
probably get into trouble again, and planned to meet me upon my release from
Golden. He had been advised that I wouldn't be released until February, and
when he learned from mother that I had gone to the Coast, he had followed and
tried to find me. </p>

<p>
I told him of my
experiences in Golden and of my trip to Australia. We spoke of the future, but
he would make no plans other than that he wanted me to go to Denver with him.
He told me that he was still peddling phoney jewelry, but that the Westerners
were pretty wise and that the take was none too good. He had found a new field
for it, however, in the bawdy houses. He did not represent it as being gold,
but merely as gold plate over a gold-colored base which would last for a year
or two. However, as he received from seventy-five cents to two dollars for
articles that cost him from ten to fifty cents, he managed to make out quite
well. His swindling had now become merely unlicensed peddling. The stuff he
sold was similar to, but of better quality than the stuff now found in
five-and-ten-cent stores. He grinned when he told me that he did not always
receive cash in payment. Barter and reciprocal trade agreements are nothing
new!</p>

<p>
Late that
afternoon we went to the Express Office, where Curly received a large valise
that he had shipped from Reno. When we opened it at the room he displayed a
large and, to me, amazing assortment of jeweled rings, brooches, and bracelets.
I asked him if he had burglarized Tiffany's, and he laughed. He said he bought
most of it from an importing firm in New York, and that it was made in Belgium
and Holland. I could hardly believe that so much magnificence could be bought
for so little.</p>

<p>
After supper we
walked about the streets, and then went to a theatre showing Uncle Tom's Cabin.
The next day, Curly loaded his pockets and mine with small boxes containing
jewelry wrapped in tissue paper. It was afternoon when we started on a round of
the hookshops (the girls usually slept till noon), and by six o'clock he had
sold at least twenty-five dollars' worth. He was propositioned several times,
but declined. He had instructed me to say little and study his methods. He lied
outrageously about the cost to him of each article, and always set the price
above what he expected to get. I learned that hookers enjoyed a bargain as much
as other women. He was offered liquor, but refused it; I was glad, for I had
not forgotten my experience with him in Louisville.</p>

<p>
That night Curly
asked me to give up mooching and try peddling, and I agreed. He proposed that I
try private homes, and the next day I did so with fair success considering my
inexperience. I sold about six or seven dollars' worth of jewelry that
afternoon, and on the way home--it was a hot July day --I went into a saloon
and ordered a large glass of lemonade. The saloon was also a gambling house
with a wheel, a couple of faro layouts, and several stud poker tables. They
were not busy at that time of day, and when I showed the bartender some of my
samples he called some of the housemen (gamblers) up to the bar. I told them
frankly that the stuff was phoney. It was a new gag to them, but almost to the
man they bought, without quibbling over the price. Half an hour later I went to
my room with about twenty dollars more in my pocket, and orders for several
articles of which I was short. One, I recall, was a gorgeous matted chain
bracelet encircled with three rows of red, green and white stones, for which I
had received five dollars. Considering that somebody once sold a string of
beads for Manhattan Island, I was still a piker. However, as I wasnt selling to
a bunch of Indians but to a lot of so-called wise guys, I didn't feel badly
about it.</p>

<p>
Curly was
surprised at my success. This new outlet that I had opened up had not occurred
to him, and his praise was unstinted. He insisted that I retain all of the
profit from my sales and carefully figured out the cost of what I had sold,
which was all he would take from me. He made it clear that he no longer
considered himself my jocker, but that
I was his pal and partner. He advised me to lie to other tramps about my age,
if asked, and to tell them I was nineteen. Younger tramps were looked upon as runaways
from their jockers, and were regarded as renegades.</p>

<p>
Curly completed
his round of the hookshops, and the next day we completed our calls on the
saloons and gambling houses. We had fared quite well in Ogden, and moved on to
Salt Lake City as paying passengers. It was the first time since leaving
Springfield that I had ridden on the cushions.</p>

<p>
Business at the
&quot;Lake&quot; was very good. There were hookshops and gambling houses
galore. It reminded me of Denver bacause of the running water in the streets and
the centralized red-light district. As in Ogden, I sold mostly to gamblers and
bartenders, and we were all of two weeks peddling the City. We had a nice room
in a second-class hotel, and each evening after supper we either went to a show
or stood around the gambling tables watching people play Faro and Roulettte. On
one of these nights I saw a drunken miner whip out a gun and take a couple of
shots at a Faro dealer whom he claimed was cheating. The miner was a bum shot,
for although he was no more than six feet from the dealer he missed him
completely. A bouncer took the miner's gun away from him and threw him out. The
dealer continued his work as though this was an everyday occurrence.</p>

<p>
When we were
ready to leave the Lake, Curly sent most of his stuff to Denver by express. We
went to two tramp hangouts and left a ten-dollar gold piece at each one with
the tramps we found there. Curly told me that by doing so, he enhanced our
reputation and that, as he was but little known to Western tramps, he wanted to
gain their good will and become known as a square shooter.</p>

<p>
The night we
left the Lake we rode a blind to Provo, where we were ditched. We found an
empty box car on a freight on a siding,
and when the freight followed the passenger train out of the yards we spread
out some newspapers, lay down and went to sleep. No shack disturbed us, and
early in the morning we reached the
town of Price.  After a washup and breakfast, we
looked the place over. It was a division point, I think, but
quite small. We found only one hookshop, which had a switchman's red signal
flag nailed to the door and a red-chimneyed lantern hanging above it. There
were two or three saloons, and our take in the town was less than two dollars.
We met several tramps there; Curly knew two of them, and we cooked and ate a
big mulligan. For the first time, I saw my monicker coupled with Curly's when
he carved on a water tank</p>

<p>
Our next stop
was in Grand Junction, Colorado. It was also a division point, but larger than
Price. We peddled the town the day we arrived. That evening we jumped the blind
baggage of a passenger train and rode to Glenwood Springs, where we were
ditched during the night. The town lay in the mountains, and the nights were quite
cool. We went to the depot and stayed in the waiting room, which was partially
warmed by a small stove in the station agent's office. We slept fitfully the
remainder of the night on the wooden benches. When we awoke we washed up and
shaved in the station's small lavatory, which the agent had evidently forgotten
to lock up, as was the usual custom in small towns.</p>

<p>
We had breakfast
at a Chinese restaurant, and when we paid the Chink, he told us of the fine
swimming to be had in the river which flowed past the railroad station.
We had not noticed the river because we had
left the station by the back entrance, but as we walked toward the station we
noticed what appeared to be a wispy light fog rising in front of it. We passed
a small general store, in whose window was a poorly lettered cardboard sign
reading, &quot;Bathing Suits for Sale, or Rent&quot;. The last two words
apparently were an afterthought, for they were printed on a piece of white
paper which was pasted to the cardboard beneath the other words. When we
reached the river, we found a small stream not more than a hundred feet across;
it seemed to be shallow, as several small boulders jutted above the surface. We
were surprised, on putting our hands in the water, to find it quite warm, and
the mist we had noticed proved to be vapor rising from several hot springs that
bubbled to the surface near the bank. I suggested renting bathing suits, but
Curly thought we might find a place where they would not be needed. We walked
down stream over rocks and boulders for a short distance, and came upon a small
pool in which two young women were swimming and splashing each other. We
stopped to watch them, and presently they climbed out of the pool and stood on
a large rock not more than fifty feet away, turning their bodies as they dried
themselves in the sun. They were probably the wives or daughters of some of the
natives, for we found afterwards that there were no hookshops in the town. We
remained hidden until they had dressed and gone.</p>

<p>
The Jew who
owned the general store rented us skirted bathing suits for fifty cents each.
We changed clothes in a back room of the store and went down to the river
again, where we lolled about in the shallow water near the stastion until
mid-afternoon. It was delightful there with mountains all about us, some of the
distant peaks still showing patches of snow, and I was reluctant to leave; but
that night found us on top of a freight train (all the cars were sealed) bound
for Leadville. We lay on our bellies, as it was tunnel country, on top of the
second or third car from the engine in order to get as much warmth as we could
from the engine's smoke, for the night was quite cold. Our nearness to the
engine nearly proved our undoing, for in the first tunnel we passed through the
red-hot cinders beat down upon us like fiery hail from Hell, getting down our
necks and burning blisters on our backs and hands. When we turned about, the
cinders went up our pants legs. Fortunately, the tunnel was a short one. We
crawled back some six or seven cars where the air was free from the smoke that
had blinded and choked us; and now it was cold. Riding the deck of a boxcar on
a narrow-gauge railroad, with the train rounding sharp curves, is no picnic
under the best of conditions. One expects the train to topple over at any
moment, and instinctively sidles over to the outside of a curve to help balance
the car. We were glad to climb down at the next stop, a water tank and
telegraph station, where we built a small fire of brushwood and slept on the
bare ground beside it for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>
We couldn't buy,
beg or steal any breakfast there. Curly carved our monickers on the tank. We
washed up as best we could and went to the telegraph station, where we learnet
that there wouldn't be any eastbound train until about midnight, when the only
daily passenger train came through. The operator said this train had to stop
for orders and water but that it was a hard train to beat, We decided to board
it and pay our way to Leadville, an untrampish action to say the least, and one
which few tramps could afford. We were so famished we had the train
&quot;Butcher&quot; jumping up half the night bringing us bananas, candy and
peanuts. At Leadville we had a grand cleanup, buying new shirts and Stetson
hats, after which we filled our bellies, rented a room, and slept until the
following morning.</p>

<p>
Leadville was a
large town, with more &quot;dens of iniquity&quot; than one could shake a stick
at. We stayed there about four days and sold all the small stock we carried
except for a few wide, oval-topped wedding rings which proved to be poor
sellers. I had several in my vest pocket and was wondering where I could sell
them. I had stopped before a jewelry store, in front of which stood a young
woman looking at some trays of rings
displayed in the window. I made some remark about the nice-looking rings, more
than half expecting a rebuff. She did not get uppish, and I was wishing I had
some of our classy stuff to show her. We talked for a minute or so, and finally
I fished one of the wedding rings out of my pocket, told her it was phony, and
said something about how much fun she could have making her friends believe she
was married. She became interested at once, and bught two rings at $1.50 each;
one, she said, was for a friend. From that day on, wedding rings became one of
our best sellers in the cities and nearby small towns. I sold many hundreds of
them during the next two years to factory workers (both men and women), store
clerks, school teachers and others, my spiel to the men being something about
how nice it would be, when registering at a hotel with their best girls, to
have the hotel clerk glimse that badge of respectability upon their
sweethearts' fingers. Women, I learned, were no more virtuous then than now,
although quite a bit more careful.</p>

<p>
I had found a
new outlet for our stuff which was to serve us in good stead a few months later
when, due to high tariffs or failure of either the importer or manufacturer, we
were unable to get supplies of the more flashy jeweled stuff. We could still
get American-made jeweled rings and brooches, but they were an inferior product
and what was worse, they showed it. The wedding rings cost eighty-five cents a
dozen for the cheaply plated ones; the &quot;acid-test&quot; ones cost about
$1.25 a dozen in gross lots. We used the acid-test ones, carrying a small
bottle of nitric acid and a testing stone with us, and representing our wares
as being &quot;gold rolled&quot;. We carried a few of the cheaper ones to
demonstrate with. We had learned that one rub of the upper face of the cheap
ones on the testing stone would make a mark that turned bright green when a
drop of acid was placed on it. We could give the edge (not the face) of an
acid-test ring several light rubs without cutting through the gold. It would
fool some jewelers, but not a pawnbroker.</p>

<p>
After leaving
Leadville, we made the rest of the trip leisurely.</p>

<p>We
rode through the Royal Gorge in an empty boxcar with both side doors open and,
as we were going downhill, we traveled pretty fast.. At one moment we thought we
were going to be thrown into the Arkansas River a thousand feet or more below,
and the next, we expected to be dashed against the canyon wall. I truly believe
that at some points the canyon wall was less than a foot from the side of the
car. That trip was the first time that either of us had ridden on a
narrow-gauge railroad, for we had gone to the coast via the Union Pacific.
Later on I got used to it. We rested a day at Salida, and stopped over for a
day or two at Pueblo. We visited the notorious &quot;Bucket of Blood&quot;
saloon, gambling house, and variety show, and climbed the mesa south of the
river. We continued on to Colorado Springs, and walked over to Colorado City
and through the Garden of the Gods. We made a feeble attempt to climb Pike's
Peak, but gave it up after a mile or two when our legs and breath gave out. We
reached Denver the next morning, and I was delighted to feel my mother's arms
about me and to hear her comforting voice again.</p>

<p>
We took mother
to Tortoni's, a high-class restaurant, and after supper went to the Tabor Opera
House for the show. Maybe it was one of the Kiralfy Brothers' extravaganzas, or
maybe Nat Goodwin, Otis Skinner, Julia Marlowe, or Modjuska. It was a good
show, and definitely did not have Lillian Russell in the cast; mother could
never view the wearing of tights with equanimity.</p>

<p>
The next night,
mother, Curly, and I held a conference regarding my future. Mother wanted me to
go to school or learn a trade. I wanted to continue on the road with Curly.
Curly was between the devil and the deep blue sea. He wanted me with him, yet
he supported my mother's contention. He said that the phoney jewelry racket was
about played out in the East and South, that the West would be the same within
a year or two, and that tramping as a career would only make me a drunken sot.
</p>

<p>
That night Curly
told me how he became a tramp. His father and mother, still living, were
well-to-do and had seen him through high school, after which he had gone in
with his father to learn the fur business. He had not liked buying and selling
raw pelts and gave it up to enter a wholesale provision house. He graduated
from the shipping department to outside sales, and married the daughter of a
rich lumberman when he was twenty-five. After two years, he and his wife
quarreled and separated. He took to drinking heavily, and though he managed to
secure good positions from time to time, his periodical sprees were not
tolerated by his employers. Finally, he found it impossible to obtain work
because of lack of references. He left Detroit, went to Chicago, and worked as
a bookkeeper for a lumber firm until his next spree. After being discharged, he
started tramping about the country, first begging and then selling phoney
jewelry. He had been tramping for six years, he said, going home for a couple
of months each winter to be with his parents and to see his son and daughter,
at which times he managed to refrain from drinking. He told me that for more
than a year now he had conquered the desire to get drunk, that he was satisfied
that he had mastered the habit, and that when he went home this coming winter
he intended to seek a reconciliation with his wife who, he said, still loved
him, and see if he couldn't rehabilitate himself.</p>

<p>
Tears came to
his eyes when he spoke of his children, and my hand sought his in a comforting
gesture. I was pleased to learn of his apparent victory over the liquor habit
and promised that, if he would take me east with him, I would return to mother
and go to school, during the winter at least. I reminded him of his promise to
take me to New York, when we first met under the water tank in a small Indiana
village, and he laughed. I promised mother that I would take good care of
myself and not get into any more reform schools, and for the first time in my
life I asked for her consent. After questioning Curly, in whom it was clear she
had considerable confidence, she agreed, and I was jubilant. I hugged both of
them and I could see that Curly, too, was pleased.</p>

<p>
Curly and I
stayed in Denver for almost a week before leaving. I did not dare do any
peddling in Denver because I was under parole from Golden and had to write a
letter to the superintendent each month giving an account of my activities. I
had been required to do the same for
the Plainfield school, but had discontinued doing so when we first came to
Denver. However, I had decided to give Indiana a wide berth on our way east.
</p>

<p>
While Curly was
working, I bummed around town. I used to stand by the hour at the southeast
corner of Seventeenth and Holliday streets (Market Street then, I believe)
watching Soapy Smith sell suckers what appeared to be twenty-dollar bills
wrapped around a small piece of soap, for a dollar each. Although he told his
customers not to open the package in the crowd that stood about, every once in
a while a &quot;purchaser&quot; would do so, bringing to light a perfectly good
twenty-dollar bill. He was a copper or shill, of course, and would gleefully
wave the bill around his head as he elbowed his way out of the crowd--to return
half an hour later and repeat the performance.</p>

<p>
Soapy was
clever, and worked entirely within the law. He had a police permit, I had been
told, to peddle soap on the city streets. He stood upon a small raised platform
which he kept stored in a nearby saloon when not working. He usually worked
from about noon until five P.M., when he would close his valise, fold up the
canvas-topped collapsible stand on which the valise was setting, and depart.
</p>

<p>
When he opened
up for business he would get a crowd about him by having one of his helpers
play a mouth organ. He would then launch into s short spiel about the wonderful
properties of the marvelous Yaqui Indian Cactus Soap. He would remove the
wrapping from a piece of it, no larger than half of a man's little finger, and
after showing the crowd a twenty-dollar bill he would wrap the bill around the
piece of soap, replace the original wraping, and press the small package
against the sharp metallic edge of the valise, cutting the outer wrapper in
such a way as to leave a portion of the bill exposed. He would then wave the
package before the eyes of his audience and toss it into one side of the
flat-sided valise among some hundred or more unbroken packages, stir them up
with his fingers, and offer to let anyone pick the money-wrapped packet out of
the lot upon payment of one dollar, meanwhile emphasizing that he was selling
the soap and not the twenty-dollar bill.</p>

<p>
The purchaser
was permitted to paw over the lot, until he found the packet which he fondly
hoped would be the lucky one, and which he identified by the exposed green
underwrapping. There would be several in the crowd offering dollars to Soapy,
but the first purchaser was always a capper; and while the capper was searching
through the numerous packages, Soapy would be wrapping other twenty-dollar
bills around other pieces of soap, one of which he would apparently toss into
the valise as soon as the first piece had been withdrawn, thus keeping the ball
rolling as long as an upraised fist with a dollar in it was in sight.</p>

<p>
When the crowd
stopped buying, Soapy would fold up the valise, make some biting remark about
the timidity of tenderfeet, and go into the saloon. When the crowd had
dispersed, he would come out and start the ballyhoo all over again. He was so
clever that, although I knew his pitch was a swindle, I often found myself with
my hand in my pants pocket, scratching my fingernail over the milling of a
silver dollar, and with an itch in my credulous mind to buy at least once. The
suckers, of course, found only a piece of green paper about the size of the
revenue stamps customarily pasted over the bungs of beer barrels.</p>

<p>
Denver, in those
days, was a stinkpot in more ways than one. Holliday Street (ex Market) from
Seventeenth Street to Twenty-second Street was packed solidly with hookshops on
both sides of the street, with the Central and Haymarket theatres --both low
variety houses--wedged in between. Saloons in the downtown district were
everywhere, while gambling houses lined the north side of Lorrimer Street from
Sixteenth to Nineteenth Street. To add to these moral stinks, there were the
sulfurous fumes from the Argo Smelter north of town which, when the wind was
from the northeast (as it frequently was), made it impossible to get a breath
of fresh air. The streets, however, were kept clean; water ran down the gutters
of most of them, as it did in Salt Lake City. To lie in the gutter there was to
lie in Denver&quot;s cleanest spot; yet I lived in Denver long enough to see
the entire city, beginning shortly before Mayor Spee's administration
and while he was head of the Board of Public
Works, become one of the most desirable spots on earth.
