Editor's preface</big></b></p>

<p>
This is a narrative by and about my father, John Lewis (Jack) Everson. During
the period 1942-1945 I was in the Naval Reserve and was away from Oakland for
most of the time. During this time (1) he contracted cancer, from which he
eventually died after unsuccessful surgery, and (2) perhaps acting on my
suggestion, he started reviewing his life and writing it down as he remembered
it. He was bedridden for the last year or more of his life, and the process
of life-review at least helped to ameliorate the tedium of this period. He
died in the summer of 1945; I was stationed in San Pedro at the time and was
unable to attend his funeral. At some later date, I hurriedly typed up his
manuscript, but not much was done with it at the time. Partly because it might
be of historical interest to members of the Tribe and partly because of
awareness that my own time is running out, I retyped the rough draft with more
attention to the editorial process. For the most part, it is reproduced almost
verbatim; editorial changes were pretty much limited to shortening long and
unwieldy sentences and eliminating redundances.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>To summarize very briefly:</b> he ran away from home at an early age
after a quarrel with his father. He hit the road and became a tramp, a
lifestyle he describes here in considerable detail. Along the way he spent
time in a reform school and a jail or tow, travelled widely, acquired a
considerble variety of skills and vocations, was married three times, and
finally settled for a reasonably successful conventional career as an
automobile insurance agent.</p>

<p>
As for his basic nature and character, you will have to decide for yourself.
He certainly, and admittedly, fell a good awys short of moral perfection. Still,
I must marvel at the variety of experience he managed to crowd into his 72 years.
My personal recollections are of a highly intelligent and affectionate man who,
despite his faults, was a kind and loving parent who taught me much and shared
with me music, baseball games, mushroom hunts, fishing trips, and a
considerable degree of intellectual comraderie. I'm willing to settle for that.
