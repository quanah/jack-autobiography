Chapter 6</b></p>

<p><A name="alice9" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice9">
The officer who took me to Plainfield was considerate,
though he kept me handcuffed either to him or to the car seat during the
journey.</A> He allowed me to smoke, and cheered me up by telling me that if I
behaved myself at the school I could be paroled to some nice family within a
year. I don't think I really believed him, but on the principle of wishful
thinking I derived some comfort from his assurances. I later learned that he
had told the truth.</p>

<p>
On arriving at
Plainfield we were met at the station by the school bus, driven by a black boy
about sixteen years of age. dressed in blue jeans. He was arrogant in his
manner and made me give him the package of cigarettes I carried, not even
letting me keep one to smoke on the drive of a mile or so to the school.
However, as soon as we started, the officer --who was seated in back with me
still handcuffed to him--lit a cigarette and, after taking a puff or two, gave
it to me.</p>

<p>
Arriving at the
school, we all went into the Superintendent's office where the handcuffs were
removed. Commitment papers were given to a frail little woman who, I later
learned, was the superintendent's wife, and I was formally booked. The driver
laid my pack of cigarettes on the desk and went out. The woman emptied the
cigarette container, which to my surprise contained only two cigarettes; it had
been nearly full when I had given it up. I wanted to mention this, but decided
not to. After answering a lot of questions I was given a printed list of the
rules and regulations governing the conduct of inmates and was told to keep and
study them. I was told that I had sixteen demerit points against my name, and
that I could reduce them by two each month if I behaved myself. This, it
appeared, would make me eligible for parole at the end of eight months. I
resolved then and there to become a model prisoner.</p>

<p>
While I was
being instructed, an enormous hulk of a man entered the office and sat down in
an oversized chair, where he fanned himself and mopped his brow with a
handkerchief. He was the fattest man I had ever seen outside of a museum or
sideshow. He was the school superintendent, and his name was Charlton. He must
have weighed at least four hundred pounds, and reminded me of one of the
enormous hogs I had once seen at Libby's packing house in Chicago. He did not
seem to notice me, and presently I was led away by two jean-clad boys. They
took me to a bathroom where I was required to wash and scrub myself thoroughly
before being allowed to don an ill-fitting suit of blue jeans with muslin-lined
long pants, in which I felt very uncomfortable. My hair had been clipped close,
and my head rubbed with a liberal quantity of what appeared to be blue
ointment, a mercurial product much used at the time for delousing and for the
treatment of syphillis. </p>

<p>
When
I was cleaned to the satisfaction of my older companions, I was
given a pair of cotton socks and brogue
shoes. I was then taken to another building, where about thirty boys, ranging
in age from about seven to eighteen, were seated at desks in a schoolroom. A
middle-aged, pleasant-featured man, with greying hair cut pompadour-style, was
talking to the class and diagramming scenes of the Holy Land on the blackboard.
I had come in upon a Sunday school lesson. We sat down, and when the class was
over the teacher came up to me, shook my hand, and led me into his living room.
When we were seated he introduced himself as &quot;Brother&quot; Drake
and
told me I would henceforth be a member of his &quot;family&quot;. He told me
that his family was number nine and that my individual number was in the
twenty-one hundreds; and he impressed upon me the necessity of yielding
obedience to him at all times. After he had made a note of my name and age I
was allowed to go into the yard and play with the other boys.</p>

<p>
The school
buildings, as I remember, were laid out in the form of a square, with the ofice
building on the center line of the square; the other buildings were distributed
on the north and south sides, partially enclosing a large drillfield and
playground. The Chapel was at the extreme end of the northern side, the bakery
and dining room were nearby, and the west side was open. The buildings were all
of brick and, with the exception of the office building, the second floors
served as dormitories and the windows were heavily screened. There was a large
spring near the laundry, and a large pool containing numerous trout and other
fish, so tame that they would take food from a person's hand. </p>

<p>
There were
eleven or twelve &quot;families&quot;, each consisting of some thirty to forty
members. The following morning I was assigned to the job of peeling potatoes
and onions, and preparing other vegetables for cooking and for the table. A
Brother Wade had charge of this force, and when we had prepared enough for the
day we were put to hoeing corn, killing potato bugs and similar farm duties.
Our hours were short, as there were many more inmates than needed to do all of
the necessary work. Except for about three hours a day, when we were required
to attend school, we played games such as leapfrog and one-old-cat, or read
Horatio Alger stories obtained at the library in the office building. We were
fed three times a day except on Sundays, when we received a late breakfast
after attending Sunday School, and after attending Chapel in the afternoon we
were given a cup of milk, two doughnuts and a large piece of gingerbread. The
weekday meals consisted principally of oatmeal mush and milk for breakfast,
boiled meat, vegetables and bread with margarine for dinner, and
&quot;slumgullion&quot; for supper; this being a thick flour gravy into which
had been stirred pieces of boiled beef, mutton and sowbelly, along with
potatoes, onions, and carrots. On Fridays we had boiled navy beans, creamed
salt codfish and, rarely, fresh fish of some kind. The officers' dining room
adjoined that of the inmates; they received better fare, of course, but
probably no more nourishing or wholesome. </p>

<p>
A few days later
I received my only flogging at the school, and had another demerit added to my
sixteen. Another boy and I were peeling onions; we each had a bushel basket
full to peel, and when we were about half through I left to go to the latrine.
When I returned I noticed that my basket was fuller than when I left it, and I
accused my companion of having dumped some onions from his basket into mine. He
denied it, and I punched him in the nose. Brother Wade happened to come by just
then, and when I explained the matter to him he told me that I should have
complained to him and not started a fight. He made me take off my jacket and lock
my fingers over my head, after which he proceeded to give me six lashes with a
long piece of round leather belting, such as was used on old-fashioned sewing
machines. The belting was doubled in the center, leaving the ends free to cut
into my flesh; they left long welts, the ends of which bled freely. As a matter
of poetic justice, I suppose, the other boy was ordered to finish peeling my
basket of onions as well as his, and I was sent to the infirmary to have my
wounds dressed. When I returned, he sent me to my family with a note of
explanation to Brother Drake.</p>

<p>
I later learned
that six lashes was the minimum punishment for first offences. I witnessed
several boys receive twenty lashes, and in one case, thirty. This was a big
negro boy who had escaped but had been caught and returned to the school. His
shirt was removed and his hands fastened to a rope suspended from the ceiling.
Brother Drake administered the punishment with a single round leather strap
fully half an inch thick. He stood about three feet from the boy, swinging the
strap with all his strength. and at each stroke the end of the lash would tear
skin and flesh. The strokes were not
hurried, but deliberate, with a pause of about ten seconds between strokes. The
boy flinched, but did not cry ont. At about the twenty-fifth stroke he fainted,
but the punishment continued until the full thirty strokes had been given. Then
Brother Drake, helped by a couple of the older boys, lowered the boy to the
ground, where he lay for about half an hour before he recovered consciousness.
This flogging was given in the classroom in the presence of the entire family,
some of whom were no more than eight years old; their faces were streaming with
tears before the end. From that day I hated Brother Drake, but was careful not
to let him know it. .</p>

<p>
Among the older
boys who were only mildly insubordinate, six lashes was the rule, coupled with
compulsory long hours of labor in the laundry. Here, washing of all clothing,
bedding, etc. was done by hand in low-set tubs equipped with old-fashioned
wooden washboards. It was a back-breaking job, and thirty days of it usually
sufficed to make the victim seek relief by promises of future good behavior.
Younger boys were frequently punished by requiring them to stand on one spot
with arms crossed and knees unbent for an hour each day for periods ranging
from one to thirty days.</p>

<p>
On the whole,
however, the boys were well treated and had many privileges. From March until
October, school studies were suspended and the boys were encouraged to
participate in such normal outdoor activities ss baseball, crack- the-whip, tug
of war, foot races, et cetera. The very youngest played tag and similar games.
In the winter, snowballing and football--played with a large round inflated rubber
ball--predominated, with acrobatics and gymnastics indoors.</p>

<p>
We were required
to attend Sunday school on Sunday mornings, and Chapel in the afternoon, where
preachers of various denominations alternated in trying to save our wicked
souls from &quot;Hell and Damnation&quot;, the usual topic of their sermons.
</p>

<p>
The farm lands
of the school lay to the east and south of the buildings, and so far as I know
were unfenced except for low split-rail affairs one could jump over. When our
day's work was over, I and a friend named Alonzo L. used to roam through the
pear and apple orchards into the woods beyond where we gathered beechnuts,
chinquapins, black walnuts, butternuts, hazelnuts, acorns, and other treasures.
There were maple trees which the larger boys were required to tap to provide
sap for boiling down into syrup and sugar for the officer's table.</p>

<p>
On one of these
excursions, Alonzo found a tomato-like plant bearing a yellowish fruit,
resembling a medium-sized tomato in size and shape. He was overjoyed, and told
me they were &quot;May apples&quot;. The flesh was also similar to that of a
tomato, and on eating one I was delighted. I have eaten fruits from all parts
of the world, yet never since have I tasted anything so delicious. I have often
wondered why some Indiana Luther Burbank had not propagated them for market
purposes. It may be that the plants were poor bearers, or the fruit
unshippable. If so, these faults could probably be corrected by one of our many
horticultural experiment stations;
though it is possible that living plants can no longer be found, for they were
quite rare then.</p>

<p>
Alonzo,
who was about fourteen, was an &quot;honor&quot; boy, i.e. having only a month
or two to serve before being paroled. As such, he had many privileges, one of
which was to go to Plainfield for the mail. On such trips he usually rode
bareback on one of the big farm horses, and when he returned he always brought
back with him a plentiful supply of forbidden cigarettes. Where he got the
money to pay for them, and where he was able to buy them in a small village, he
wouldn't tell. Evidently there were bootleggers then, as now. His duties,
shared with another boy called Nick, consisted of feeding, bedding, and
currying the horses, of which there were about a dozen; consequently, he had
much free time to spend as he pleased. We used to hide out in the woods,
smoking and exchanging confidences. I fear I exerted a bad influence on him,
for he told me that when he was released he was going to get himself a jocker
and become a tramp. When finally he was paroled, I fell heir to his stable
duties, although not all of his privileges. </p>

<p>
One
morning, about two months after I became an inmate of the School, a monitor boy
found me and handed Brother Wade an order to have me report to the main
building at once. The monitor escorted me to the office, and I was trembling in
my shoes, for to be summoned to appear before &quot;Fatty&quot; Charlton almost
invariably presaged punishment for an infraction of the rules too serious to be
handled by the lesser authorities. I couldn't imagine what I had done, apart
from smoking, that warranted such a procedure, and as I entered the office my
fear was so great that I could hardly walk. &quot;Fatty&quot; was seated as
usual in his big oversized chair, and Mrs. Charlton was at her desk. She came
forward, smiled at me, and told me I had visitors. I was naturally astonished,
and thought immediately of Curly. As she led me toward the Visitors' Room I
wondered how he had managed to hoodwink
her. I had told Curly my real name and had given him the address of my parents,
whom he had promised he would notify in case I was killed or badly injured. I
had not written to my parents since I ran away from home, and had no intention
of doing so while I was at the school.</p>

<p>
Sure enough,
when I entered the room, there stood Curly, all decked out in a new suit of
clothes and holding a &quot;Dicer&quot;, or Derby hat, in his hands. I could
hardly refrain from crying &quot;Curly!&quot; as I sprang to embrace him, and
as I did so, to my astonishment I saw my mother and father seated side by side
on a sofa a few feet away. I burst into tears and ran to my mother, where I
fell to my knees and, with my head in her lap, I sobbed my heart out.</p>

<p>
Mother and
father cried a lot, and tried to comfort me. When we all had regained our
composure, Curly told me that after he had been released from jail he learned
of my sentence to the reform school and for a time was undecided what to do
about it. He said his first idea was to help me escape, as he had learned
somehow that the school was without guards. He had abandoned that idea when he
learned that I would probably be released within a year and that he would
be liable to a long term of imprisonment if
he were caught. He finally decided to try and secure my release with the aid of
my parents and looked them up in Chicago, where he told them the whole story,
omitting such details of our life together as would embarrass or grieve them.
They had then come on to Plainfield to see me, with the aid of a letter given
to my father by the governor of Illinois and addressed to the governor of
Indiana, to see if they couldn't effect my pardon. However, it didn't work out.
Perhaps the governors did not belong to the same party or church; politics and
religion were taken seriously in those days. <A name="alice10" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice10">Or, possibly my father did not
really try to get me pardoned; he may have thought that a few more months of
discipline would be good for me. . .who knows?</A></p>

<p>
<A name="alice11" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice11">Father, always
thin, was much thinner than when I ran away. His breathing was labored, which I
attributed to his chronic asthma and the aneurism that I had been told he had.
</A>He was affectionate and asked me to condone the last flogging he had given me,
telling me that he had subsequently learned that Marion - damn him! - had lied
about the knife. I sat on his lap and forgave him and, with his arms about me,
I cried some more when he slipped into my hand a brand-new copper-handled
knife. That act of contrition endeared him to me more than anything he had ever
done before.</p>

<p>
Curly had gone
into the office after telling me of the part he had played in our reunion, and
after a while we all followed. Mrs. Charlton was very kind and told me I could
show my visitors about the place. She invited mother, father and Curly to have
lunch at the officers' mess; but when Curly asked if they couldn't eat at my
family's table, she smilingly consented. So when the quarter-to-twelve assembly
bell rang I took all three to my family house, where I introduced them to
Brother Drake, and from there we all marched to the dining room. After dinner I
asked for, and was given, relief from duty for the rest of the day. I showed
them all over the grounds, and then led them past the stables into the orchard.
Curly, I could tell, was dying for a smoke and when we were deep in the orchard
he lit a cigarette. He did not offer one to me, nor did I ask for one. Father
lit a cigar, while mother and I sat beneath a tree and she told me much that
had transpired since I left home. She said that father's poor health had
obliged him to give up his practice, and that they were selling our house with
the intention of moving to Kansas or Colorado, where they hoped the climate
would relieve his asthma. </p>

<p>
About five
o'clock, after repeated rests by father, we returned to the office and after
more weeping we said farewell, but not until Curly had given me a name and
address in Detroit where I was to write him whenever I could. Mother, at
Curly's suggestion, had introduced himself to Mrs. Charlton as her brother and my
uncle.</p>

<p>
I don't know
what cock-and-bull story my parents told Mrs. Charlton about how they came to
locate me at Plainfield; something Curly had cooked up, no doubt. But after
they had gone I couldn't have told which of the three I missed the most. I
wrote home once a week, and less often to Curly. Mother wrote often, enclosing
an occasional letter from father. I received but few letters from Curly, all
containing good advice concerning my behavior but telling me nothing of his
wanderings. All the mail, both incoming and outgoing, was censored at the
office, so he had to be careful. <A name="alice12" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice12">I do know that from that time until mother's
death in 1913, I never let more than ten days pass without writing to her if it
were possible to do so.</A><p>

<p>
Two or three
weeks after my folks had left, my father wrote to tell me that he had been
unable to secure my release. He begged me to be a good boy until
I could be paroled to him.</p>

<p>
Shortly after
Alonzo had been paroled and I had taken over his job, I met with an accident
that might have blinded me for life. I was helping an older boy repair some
brickwork at the stables, and in moving a small keg of dry cement I let it drop
instead of setting it down carefully. The jolt to the keg caused some of the
powder to fly into my eyes, and in a moment I was in agony. I was taken to the Infirmary,
where a physician removed the by-then caked pieces of cement and bandaged my
eyes. The pain was quite severe for several days, and the doctor kept me
sedated with an opiate. &quot;Mitts&quot; (heavy leather gloves with slots
through which a leather strap could be threaded to secure the hands immovably
across the chest) were placed on my hands to prevent me from scratching the
bandages from my eyes. Incidentally, these mitts were also used in all the
dormitories to prevent masturbation by those known to practice it.</p>

<p>
I remained in a
darkened room for a month or more before the bandages were finally removed, Two
weeks later I was allowed to go outdoors, wearing fully shielded dark green
glasses. It was near Thanksgiving, and I certainly had much to be thankful for;
there was no impairment of vision, and
disfigurement.</p>

<p>
During the
winter I attended school classes and made splendid progress, especially in
arithmetic, in which I advanced to algebra and plane geometry. The three R's
were stressed and my former bugaboos, grammar and history, were lightly passed
over. For the first time in my life I liked school, and couldn't get enough of
it. The ordinary &quot;advanced&quot; school geography proved to be inadequate,
and Brother Drake let me use his exceptionally fine and complete Atlas of the
World, containing detailed descriptions of the most fascinating places and
people imaginable, together with brief histories of their governments and
rulers.</p>

<p>
My tastes in
reading changed at the same time. <A name="alice13" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice13">Brother Drake had a small but select library
of books on such subjects as ancient history, mythology, and foreign
adventures.</A> He loaned them to me freely, and I usually kept one of them at the
stables to read in the substantial amount of free time I had between chores. In
fact, when it was not too cold, I often sat on one of the grain boxes after my
evening chores were done, and read for half an hour or more after the supper
bell had rung. It was one of my privileges to be late for supper, as was the
case with the other boys whose duties required them to be absent at that time.
We usually ate an hour later than the rest, and often got extra tidbits like
cake, pie and cookies left over from the officers' table. I think these months
were the most contented ones of my life.</p>

<p>
The winter
passed quickly, and it did not seem to be as cold as the ones I had spent in
Chicago. At Christmas time, each family had a Christmas tree and we gathered
around it on Christmas Eve to sing hymns and carols. There was no hanging up of
stockings, as we all wore long pants and socks. The following morning we
gathered around the tree again, where each boy found a small box bearing his
name and number, and containing an orange, an apple, a few nuts, and lots of
candy. Several boys, known to be good players on the harmonica, received one as
a gift from Brother Drake. In addition, a few of the boys received boxes from
home, containing mostly warm clothing such as underwear, scarves, mittens,
gloves, and earmuffs. My parents sent me a box which contained, in addition to
the usual goodies, a heavy woolen scarf and, what delighted me most, a pair of
long gauntleted fur gloves. For dinner and supper that day we had roast turkey,
cranberry sauce, and mince pie, with all the other trimmings. The feast was
talked about for weeks thereafter.</p>

<p>
Life went on
without much of special interest, and when spring came I was elegible for
parole. My parents had moved to Abilene, Kansas, from where they sent me a
complete outfit of new clothing (short pants again!) together with the
necessary legal papers to secure my release, and money for transportation. When
the happy day came, I was taken to Plainfield by Mr. Charlton, my first
personal contact with him, and he bought me my ticket. While seeing me aboard
the train, he admonished me to be a good boy.</p>

<p>
The trip was
uneventful except for the thrill I got out of crossing the Mississippi, and my
parents met me at the station at Abilene. We hugged each other and cried a bit
before mother drove us in their buggy to a small, rented frame cottage on the
north side of town. There I was greeted by my brother George, three years my
junior. He was glad to see me, and that evening regaled me with stories he had
heard of Indians, buffaloes and coyotes. We planned fishing trips to nearby Mud
Creek and more distant Smoky Hill River. George was the good boy of the family
and fulfilled the saying that &quot;the good die young&quot;; typhoid fever
claimed him in Denver about two years later.</p>

<p>
Father was a
wraith of his former self, but had lost none of his optimism. At the time, he
was associated with a Mr. George Rohrer, editor of the Abilene Gazette, and a
Mr. Burton, who later became a member of the U. S. Senate.</p>

<p>The
three engaged in a cattle-feeding venture which failed miserably, and in which
father lost several thousand dollars, virtually all he had. During the year or
more that they dithered around the stock pens and feeding yard I assisted as
much as I could. In the spring of 1887 father went to Denver, taking George
with him, and I got a job as chore boy on a nearby farm. The owners, the
Shepherds, were very kind to me and treated me as one of the family. Meanwhile,
mother secured a position as nurse or companion in the Burton household while
father, in Denver, tried to interest mining men in an ore concentration
process. In September, when mother left to join father, I too packed my few
belongings, shipped them to the folks, and jumped a westbound freight.</p>

<p>
I stopped over
at Salina and Ellis, where I started begging again; and when I arrived in Denver
I gave my mother a little more than twenty dollars, ten of which had been my
last months' wages at the Shepherds. It was thankfully received; how
thankfully, I did not realize until after her death, many years later. <A name="alice14" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice14">I found
among her effects a letter from my father, dated September 2, 1887, in which he
wrote, in part, &quot;...if you can . . .dear. send me $2- do.&quot; What
pathos and humiliation lie behind frustrated old age!</A>
</p>

<p>
I was a husky
kid for my age, and within a week had secured a job as &quot;offbearer&quot; to
a moulder in a brickyard. The bricks were formed from soft clay into a wooden
mold holding three bricks lengthwise. Five thousand bricks was a day's work for
a moulder, for which he was paid $7.50. He paid $2.50 to his offbearer, whose
duties consisted in washing and sanding the molds, running 25 yards or more
with the filled ones, dumping them, and running back with the empty mold, which
had to be washed and sanded and placed beside the moulder before the next one
could be carried away. It was a backbreaking job of five or six hours of
continuous dogtrotting, but I soon got used to it. The job lasted only about
two months before cold weather put a stop to the work. The money I earned,
however, was a boon to my parents, who by now were financially down and out.</p>

<p>
By the middle of
December I was in jail again, this time for a very good reason. I met a tramp
called &quot;Jiggers&quot; (and the name should have been a warning to me, for
in Trampdom it means &quot;watch out!&quot;). He told me he had some
&quot;peddlings&quot; from a hardware store in Kansas City. I offered to help
him peddle them, and he gave me a big .45 Colt revolver and half a dozen
razors. I had sold several of the razors and was trying to sell the Colt to a
bartender in a saloon, when a man came in and picked up the gun. He laid it
down after examining it, and asked whom it belonged to. I told him that it was
mine, and offered it for sale. He displayed a detective's badge pinned to his
vest and pocketed the gun. After handcuffing me, he led
me to the City Jail on the bank of Cherry
Creek at Larimer Street, where I was grilled for several hours in an attempt to
make me confess where I had gotten the gun and razors. I told the officers I
had found them, and stuck to my story.
However, they caught me in several lies, and the gun and razors were identified
as loot from a burglarized local hardware store. <A name="alice15" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice15">So, by the end of January,
1888 I was on my way to the reformatory at Golden, near Denver.</A></p>

<p>
While I was in
the County jail awaiting trial on a charge of burglary, father died. Mother
came to see me after the funeral, and I was glad to learn that he had known
nothing of my shame. He had been to Central City, a mining town, and had died
suddenly of a ruptured aneurism within a few hours of his return to Denver.
</p>

<p>
Mother, who was
forty-seven (my father had been sixty-nine)- had obtained a position as nurse,
and when I learned of it I did not worry so much about her. I met a couple of
tramps in the County Jail who knew Curly, whom I had not heard from in over a
year. One was called &quot;Sickness&quot;, and the other, &quot;Baldy
Todd&quot;. I met both of them again some years later, Sickness in Portland,
Ore., and Baldy in Memphis, Tenn. They both promised to get word to Curly of my
plight. One of them did, either in person or by the tramp grapevine - &quot;If
you see so-and-so, tell him such-and-such&quot; - for about three months later
I got a letter from Curly addressed to me at the school. He was still my
&quot;affectionate uncle&quot;, and promised to take care of me when I was
released.</p>

<p>
I shall not go
into much detail regarding my life at Golden. The school was operated on
practically the same plan as at Plainfield, although there were fewer inmates
and some of them were girls. A Mr. Sampson was superintendent, and my family
master was a Mr. Sam Poe. He later became sheriff of the county in which Golden
is located. He was a strict disciplinarian, but not unkind. There were only
four families; mine was number 4. I worked on the farm, learned to tie brooms
in the broom factory, and had several months in the shoe shop under a Mr. J. D.
Slater, who was also the school's bandmaster and taught me to play the B-flat
cornet. The older boys used to try to flirt with the girls, who were domiciled
in the office building, but there was no opportunity for personal contact. I
once managed to exchange love notes with a girl named Ada, after I became a
trusty and had access to the office building. She was about seventeen then, and
very pretty. I met her a couple of years later at the Central Theatre on
Holliday Street in Denver. It was a low-class variety house where girls were
employed to solicit drinks in the long row of curtained boxes that ran around
the entire inner edge of the balcony. She told me that she was diseased. We had
a drink and a cry together over her misfortune, and that was the last time I
saw her.</p>

<p>
I was paroled to
my mother just before Christmas. Her position was as an institutional nurse,
with no night work, and she had taken a small flat on Santa Fe Avenue in order
to continue her chemical experiments. She was glad to see me and urged me to go
to school again; but to her sorrow I refused, and about the middle of January
1889 I hit the road again, bound for San Francisco. I was nearly sixteen, a man
in size, and could no longer work the tearful panning spiel but had to rely on
straight mooching. I wanted to go to Australia, and by cheerful lying I managed
to get a job as wiper aboard the S.S. Rio de Janeiro. We stopped at Honolulu
outbound, and then on to Sydney and Melbourne.</p>

<p>
My intention had
been to desert the ship at Sydney and tour the country, but I gave up that idea
quickly when I found that railroads in Australia were few and far between, and
that they went nowhere in particular. Australia, I learned too, had an answer
to the tramp problem: hard labor. As that didn't appeal to me, I returned to
San Francisco quite disillusioned.</p>

<p>
I bummed around
San Francisco for a couple of weeks, and then started for Denver. At Truckee I
went to the Central Pacific R.R. water tank (now the Southern Pacific), where I
met three tramps. I nodded to them, and immediately started carving my adopted
monicker--Chi Curly-- on the tank's superstructure. I added B-E (bound east)
and the date, now forgotten.</p>

<p>
As it was the
custom for a tramp meeting two or more unknown tramps to first introduce
himself, I felt that I had complied with the convention most effectively. The
three arose, and one of them introduced himself as &quot;Sardines&quot; and
then introduced the others as Michael J. Gorman and Liverpool Tony. Gorman offered
me a drink of &quot;whiteline&quot; (alcohol and water). I took a swig, handed
the bottle back and, pulling a silver dollar from my pocket, suggested that one
of the three go up town for the makings of a mulligan. Tony, a runt of a man
with a large head and Bette-Davis-sized eyes, took the money and went toward
town while the three of us sat down again. I asked if either of them knew
Michigan Curly. Much to my surprise, Sardines said yes and added that Curly had
been in Truckee the day before and had gone east. He showed me Curly's monicker
carved on the other side of the tank, and I inwardly cried with joy. I
concealed my excitement, and casually
mentioned that Curly was my partner; but I was on tenterhooks the rest of the
day, and could barely eat a small portion of the fine mulligan Gorman cooked
for us. Tony offered me some change from the dollar I had given him, but I
refused it.</p>

<p>
When night came,
I got Sardines and Gorman to spring open the side door of a loaded and sealed
freight car containing sacked ore concentrates consigned to the Argo Smelter in
Denver. When I had gotten inside the car, one of them passed me a couple of
fishplates (flat steel plates, used to join rail ends) , a crowbar, (stolen, no
doubt, from the section foreman's tool house), and a block of wood to be used
as a fulcrum and wedge when springing myself out of the car at Ogden or Denver.
They passed in some food and water, and sprung the door back onto its rails.
They wished me good luck; and when the train pulled out about an hour later I
was assured of being undisturbed for several days.</p>

<p>
Two days later I
reached Ogden and started on a hunt for Curly. He had not been seen at any of
the tramp hangouts, and I concluded that he had not reached the city but had
taken leisurely jumps from town to town, while I had come straight through. I
haunted the freight yard day and night, and after four or five days had passed
I decided to backtrack toward Reno. I swung onto the blind baggage of a
slow-moving westbound
passenger train as it went through the
yards, but only got as far as the first stop when I was &quot;ditched&quot;. It
was night, and as I sat beside the water tank waiting for another train I
checked my impatience and considered the matter in the light of probabilities.
I reasoned
that if Curly&nbsp;was really B.E. he would sooner or later reach
Ogden and leave some evidence, so I caught a freight that stopped for water and
returned to Ogden.</p>

<p>
As I dropped off
in the yards I saw several others do likewise. I called to them, but Curly was
not among them. I talked with one of them; his monicker was
&quot;The Houligan&quot;. He was an
Austrian, about twenty years old, and spoke broken English. He told me that he
had seen Curly at Elko, Nevada the previous day. I paid for a couple rounds of
drinks in an all-night saloon, we had breakfast together in a Chinese
restaurant near the depot, and parted.</p>

<p>
Two days later
as I loitered about the yards, ducking switch engines and watchmen, I saw Curly
about two hundred feet away coming toward me. I recognized his long, swinging
gait and ran toward him. He didn't recognize me and tried to avoid me by
ducking under a freight car, but when I yelled &quot;Curly!&quot; a couple
times he rose and waited. I fell into a walk and when I got about fifty feet
from him, he grinned and came toward me. I could scarcely get words of greeting
out of my mouth as I embraced him, and tears streamed down my cheeks. We
stopped short and looked each other over approvingly. He hadn't changed a bit.
H wore the same cheerful smile I had learned to love, his voice had the same
deferential quality, and the expression of his face and eyes bore the same
benignity I had known in the past.</p>
