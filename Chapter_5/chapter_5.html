Chapter 5</b></p>

<p>
There was a large river flowing
through the city, which Curly said was the Ohio. We did not look for the
jungles, but located a cheap rooming house where Curly engaged a room for the
week and introduced me as his son. The room contained a couple of old
cane-seated chairs, a dilapidated dresser, a commode with a large china basin
and pitcher, and a wooden bed with the usual &quot;donicker&quot; (chamberpot)
beneath it. A flight of rickety stairs led down to a large privy in the back
yard. <A name="alice8" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice8">Above the central door of the privy swung a white sign, upon which was
printed in large black letters an admonitory &quot;Don't .... .. ...
....&quot;.</A> The inner whitewashed walls were covered with the usual backhouse
poets' effluvia.</p>

<p>
We ate what we could of the
remainder of our lump, and fed the rest to a large black Newfoundland dog whose
name, by coincidence, was &quot;Curly&quot;. After our meal, Curly told me to
remain in the room while he went to the postoffice. He returned in about an
hour with a small package which he opened on the bed. It contained several
smaller packets, which upon being opened caused me great wonderment. There were
several dozen plain and gem-studded rings,several brooches, and three
fine-looking watches. He laughed at my amazement and told me they were &quot;phoney&quot;.
He said that he had ordered them by mail from Chicago at a total cost of about
five dollars, and that he expected to sell them for about two hundred. in fact,
he received considerably more.</p>

<p>
He sold
one of the &quot;diamond&quot; rings that same night to a negro preacher who
was conducting a revival meeting nearby. His story was that his
wife had died and that the bauble had been her engagement
ring. However, the usual story was to make the buyer believe that the property
had been stolen. This left no comeback for the buyer, for if he complained to
the police they would either laugh at him or scold him for buying
&quot;stolen&quot; property.</p>

<p>
We both enjoyed the antics of the
revivalists that evening as we sat on a rear bench near the entrance to a large
tent where the meetings were held. The minister's exhortations must have
carried conviction to the several hundred listeners, for when the collection
plates were passed almost everyone dropped a coin or two into them. The plates
were so heavy with coins that before the two collectors had completed their
job, they had to use both hands to keep the pan level. I wanted to leave, but
Curly said he wanted to see the preacher. After the crowd had left, he led me
by the hand to the platform where the preacher and his two assistants were
counting the evening's take. Curly asked the preacher for a word in private,
and the preacher asked his helpers to leave. When they had retired to the back
of the tent Curly introduced me as his son, complimented the preacher on his
eloquence, and began his spiel about the engagement ring. He offered to let him
have the ring for fifty dollars, but the preacher was wary. He asked if the
diamond would cut glass, and Curly assured him it would. The preacher handed
the ring back with some remark about proving it, went to the rear of the tent,
and returned with a small mirror. Curly drew the stone of the ring acoss one
corner of the mirror and to my surprise, and probably the preacher's, the stone
had made a plainly perceptible scratch. The preacher seemed satisfied and began
to dicker. He offered twenty dollars, and Curly dropped to forty. The preacher
raised his offer by degrees to twenty-five dollars while Curly came down
to thirty. Finally Curly took me by the
hand and turned to go, and the preacher capitulated. They sat down and began
counting the evening's collection, which in dollars, half dollars and quarters
alone amounted to a little more than twenty-five dollars. The preacher gave
Curly twenty-five in silver, then opened his pocketbook and extracted a
five-dollar greenback which he folded and placed in Curly's hand. He picked up
the ring, stuck it in his purse, and with a &quot;God bless you, brother&quot;
accompanied us to the tent's entrance and bade us a pleasant goodnight.</p>

<p>
We found a
small restaurant, had a good supper and went to our room. Curly emptied his
pockets of the silver, tied it in a handkerchief, and slipped it under the
mattress. He produced the five-dollar bill, unfolded it, scrutinized it
carefully, and burst out laughing. It was a five-dollar bill, alright, but
Confederate money, worth about ten cents a thousand. I was indignant and wanted
Curly to take it back and make the preacher exchange it for a good one, but he
only smiled. He held the bill over the chimney of our kerosine lamp until it
blazed, and lit a cigarette with it, after which we tumbled into bed.</p>

<p>
The next
day Curly hunted up likely-looking spots for me to work, rehearsed me in my
spiel, and turned me loose. I was fearsome and nervous at first, but as one
success followed another I gained confidence and by three o'clock that
afternoon I had turned over to Curly, who collected after each contribution,
nearly five dollars.</p>

<p>
Apart from the day of the cornmeal
episode, I averaged about six dollars for each day of about five hours' work.
Curly worked the streets and saloons in the early evening hours with his phoney
jewelry, and must have taken in at least twice as much as I. We moved to a more
cheerful room in a better neighborhood at the end of the week, and ate at better
restaurants. Curly bought me a new outfit of clothes, and got himself a new
suit, shoes and hat. The hat was a J. B, Stetson felt, which no self-respecting
tramp would be seen without if he could help it. The Stetson, I learned, was a
badge
of quality
in trampdom, as it was for most railroad men at the time. Evenings we usually
spent at home playing cribbage or casino, or at one of the several negro
minstrel shows near the river. Saturdays, there was a baseball game; but as we
were in Louisville for only four weeks, I saw only a couple of them. Begging
was really a more exciting game to me; I had grown to like it.</p>

<p>
Beginning the second week, Curly
suggested that I try &quot;panning&quot; for a dollar instead of the usual
fifty cents. I did so, but we soon abandoned it. My tears seemed to be able to
extract fifty cents' worth of sympathy from my victims, but they went cold on
the dollar. I think my first day netted only three dollars, and my second day
two. On one of those days a young man, to whom I had told my sorrowful tale
without apparent effect, passed on but came back a few minutes later as I was
giving the &quot;pan&quot; to another man. He had a small crowbar with him. We
pried up one of the two planks between which I had told him of dropping a
dollar, and we all had a good search. There was such a mess of disintegrated
horse manure, bits of paper, and other small trash that it was like looking for
the proverbial needle. I found a large copper two-cent piece and the young man
found a dime, which he pocketed. He replaced the plank and left, and I sat down
on the sidewalk and began to sob. The other man stood watching me for a minute
or two, and the fever of his sympathy finally rose to the dollar point. He
slipped one into my hand, and with a comforting word or two went on his way.
Curly, who had witnessed the whole affair, went into convulsions of laughter
when I joined him a few minutes later, and we called it a day.</p>

<p>
That night, Curly started on a
spree. He came to the room about ten o'clock carrying a gallon jug and two
quart bottles of whisky. He had had a few drinks, but was sober enough to
instruct me how to care for him during his debauch, and begged me not to leave
him alone when he was awake. He seemed confident that I wouldn't leave him; and
he was right, for by now I simply adored him. He gave me a large roll of bills
which he told me to hide. I was to keep the whisky for him to sober up on after
he had consumed the contents of the jug, which he told me contained pure
alcohol. I was to dilute this to half-strength with water and administer it to
him when he asked for it. When the alcohol was gone, I was to give him the
whisky in diminishing doses of about two ounces every two to three hours, and
gradually increase the time between doses. I was to refuse to go out and buy
more for him, and I was not to allow him to smoke unless I held the cigarette
for him while he did so. As for food, he said he would want nothing. It was
quite a burden to lay upon the shoulders of an eleven-year-old boy, but I
resolved to do the best I could.</p>

<p>
By midnight, the bottle of whisky
was two-thirds gone and Curly was in a stupor. He had undressed and gotten into
bed before becoming helpless, and before going to bed I poured out another
drink for him and set it on the stand beside his bed. I turned the gas light
down low and lay down beside him, but I couldn't go to sleep. I was frightened
for fear of what might happen to him if I failed him in any way, and lay there
sobbing my heart out. I must have dozed off, however, for it was getting
daylight when Curly awoke and asked me for a drink. I gave him the one I had
poured out and refilled the glass; but within a few minutes he asked me for
another drink, which I gave him, refilling the glass with what remained in the
bottle. I then got up, filled the whisky bottle half-full of alcohol from the
jug, and aded an equal amount of water. By now it was daylight, so I got
dressed and sat beside him on the bed, holding his hand and stroking it.</p>

<p>
When he started on the alcohol he
would take four or five drinks at intervals of about fifteen minutes, then fall
asleep and sleep for three or four hours. During these sleeping periods I would
go out and buy my meals, return with two or three dime novels, and read until
he awoke with further demands for liquor. He had soiled the sheets, and I
bribed the chambermaid to change them and wash his underwear. I washed his body
myself.</p>

<p>
This kept up for several days, and
when the alcohol gave out I started to sober him up with the whisky. He could
no longer hold the glass, and after a vain effort on my part to pour it into
his mouth I borrowed a tablespoon and fed it to him in that way. He begged me
for more than he had instructed me to give him, but I kept firmly to the
formula he had prescribed. He once tried to get out of bed to take it from me,
but was unable to do so. He was all a-tremble, and had no more strength than a
two-year-old child.</p>

<p>
When the bottle was about
three-fourths empty he fell asleep and slept for about twelve hours. He was so
quiet that for a time I thought he was dying, and was on the verge of calling
in a doctor, contrary to his instructions
However,I couldn't disobey him. I lay beside him on the bed, crying bitterly,
and when he finally awoke the sound of his voice as he stroked my head was a
never-to-be-forgotten joy. I cried now with happiness, and
when he
asked me for a cigarette I lit one and held it to his
lips as his hand sought mine and stroked it affectionately. He asked for a
drink of water and I held the glass to his lips, nearly choking him in my
eagerness to get the water down his throat. He drank five or six glasses of
water, smoked several cigarettes, and fell asleep again. With contentment in my
heart, I undressed and got into bed.</p>

<p>
He woke me several times during the
night for water and cigarettes. When morning came he sent me to our landlady to
ask that tshe make some soup for him. She was most sympathetic, telling me that
she knew just what would be best for a man in his condition, and that she would
provide for him. She kept her promise, and several days later Curly was up and
around, although still too nervous to shave himself. He looked funny with a
week's growth of hair on his face.</p>

<p>
I returned the roll of bills which
he had given into my care, and about ten days later we rambled out of
Louisville and went to Indianapolis. We stayed there about ten days, and Curly
received another lot of phoney jewelry which he peddled. I did not do nearly as
well there as in Louisville; about three dollars a day was my average. As
neither of us liked the city, we started for Toledo, Ohio, which he said was a
good town. We planned to work only the larger cities, like Cleveland and
Buffalo, until we reached New York.</p>

<p>
He estimated that
by that time we would have nearly a thousand dollars to tide us through the
winter. He told me we already had close to four hundred dollars, and tnat he
expected to sell quite a lot of stuff in Toledo. He punned the name of the
city, singing &quot;We're going to To-le-do, to lead a better life.&quot; I
liked it.<p>

<p>
We stopped
off at Fort Wayne, Indiana, and that stopover proved to be our undoing. We had
entirely given up seeking the company of other tramps in the jungles; in fact,I
don't recall any meetings since we left
new Orleans Frenchy and Cincinnati Red after our encounter with them. We went
up town, where he played a joke on me by telling me about a &quot;rose-water
fountain&quot; which he promised me I would enjoy. When we were half a block
away, he bade me hold my nose until I had sampled its contents. He led me to a
fountain in front of the Court House, to which several drinking cups were
attached, and filling one with water, he bade me drink. I took one mouthful and
dropped the cup; the water had a sickening taste and smelled like rotten eggs.
I was angry for a moment, then joined in his laughter and playfully kicked him.
</p>

<p>
Before we had gone more than a
block, we were in serious trouble. A man, accompanied by an officer, came up
behind us and stopped us. The man told the officer that Curly had swindled him,
and we were promptly arrested. I had no idea what it was all about until we got
to the city jail. There the man claimed that Curly had sold him a phoney watch
a couple of months before, representing it to be gold, and had told him that he
was a railroad trainman out of work. They locked us up in separate cells after
I had given the name Curly had told me to use in case of a &quot;pinch&quot;,
and told the officer that Curly was my father. Curly's accuser stated that he
had recognized Curly as we stood before the fountain and had followed us,
picking up the arresting officer on the way.</p>

<p>
Curly was tried the next morning,
convicted of petit larceny, sentenced to thirty days in jail, and led away. I
was taken back to jail where, after a long grilling, I admitted that Curly was
not my father. I gave my right name, but insisted that both my parents were
dead. A few days later I was sentenced to the reform school at Plainfield,
Indiana, until I became twenty-one, unless I was sooner paroled. In contemplation
of ten long years to serve, I cried my
heart out.</p>
