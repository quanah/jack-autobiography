Chapter 2</b></p>

<p>
It was a beautiful sunny morning, and
as I walked down the alley toward 22nd Street the thought uppermost in my mind
was to avoid being seen by my mother, who might be shopping nearby. I
cautiously approached the intersection and looked up and down the street.
Seeing nothing of mother, I darted across the street and past the alley
entrance to a basement occupied by a Chinese laundry. It was one down whose
cellar stairs I had several times helped other boys roll heavy empty beer
barrels, which thundered down the steps and crashed loudly into the doors
below, invariably shattering the glass they contained. I continued on my way to
16th Street and Indiana Avenue, where fortunately (or so I thought at the time)
I encountered one of the Patch Gang, a boy of about 14 named Timothy Flynn.</p>

<p>
Tim was a parolee from an Illinois
reform school, who had run away from home on two or three occasions, once
making his way as far as New York. As I had decided to see that fabulous city,
I eagerly sought Tim's advice on getting there. Our conversation must have
fired his mind with wanderlust, for he volunteered to accompany me and I
agreed. He went home and returned shortly, clad in even more disreputable
clothing than he wore when I met him. We went down to the Illinois Central R.
R. yards (which, incidentally, were used by the Nickel Plate, Michigan Central,
and other railroads) where we waited for a southbound freight. When the first
one came along that was going slowly enough for us to flip onto it, we did so,
one from each side, and clambered onto a flatcar. We made our way to the end of
the car and through the end door of a boxcar adjoining. The car was empty and,
being hungry, we soon disposed of the food I had brought.</p>

<p>
I don't know how far we had gone-- probably
not more than thirty or forty miles-- when the train came to a stop. Within a
few minutes the side door of the car was slid open; a brakeman poked his head
into the doorway and, seeing us, ordered us out. We dropped to the ground and
walked toward the engine. When the train pulled out I started to board it
again, but Tim stopped me. He told me later that once a shack had put me off a
train it was best not to try to ride that particular train further, for if
caught again by the same man I was apt to get sapped.</p>

<p>
We had stopped at
a small village with a depot and water tank beside the track. We met a couple
of men lounging by the tank and asked them the name of the town. They told us,
and one of the men, who had been carving his initials on the base of the tank,
became quite friendly. He rolled and gave us the first hand-rolled cigarettes I
had ever seen, and though I did not like the flavor as well as that of the
&quot;Old Judge&quot; and Sweet Caporals&quot; to which I was accustomed, I
proudly inhaled the smoke and blew it out through my nose to show that I was no
novice at smoking.</p>

<p>
The other tramp
(for they were tramps) suggested to Tim that they walk up to the depot to find
when the next freight would go through. This was probably a pretext to separate
us, so that they might more easily use their persuasive powers to get us to
team up with them. At any rate, as soon as Tim and his companion had gone, my
companion began to work on me. He asked me to tell him all about myself and my
ambitions, and as he was exceedingly friendly, I did so except that I gave him
a fictitious name. He was ery sympathetic and told me that if I would ditch
Tim, he would take me along to New York with him where he would show me the
most wonderful sights and provide for my welfare in a manner beyond my most
hopeful dreams; and I agreed.</p>

<p>
After a while,
Tim and his companion (I later learned that he bore the moniker &quot;Boston
Slim) returned, and Tim began repeating to me the glowing accounts Slim had
told him of California with its multitude of Ice Cream Caves, Lemonade Springs,
and so forth. Tim said he had decided to go west with Slim, and asked me if I
wouldn't prefer California to New York. I was about to say yes when my
companion interrupted and told them that we had decided to go to New York first
and that we would follow them to California later. I believe I was disappointed
at the time, but somehow he convinced me that his plan would be the best; so
early that evening when a west-bound freight stopped for water, Tim and I
parted to go our respective ways. I never saw or heard of him again.</p>

<p>
&quot;Michigan Curly&quot;-- that was
my companion's moniker-- had so won my confidence that I entrusted to him the
several dollars that I had stolen from home. He was pleased and promised to
keep it safely for me. He told me not to have any conversation with any tramps
who might come along while he was gone to get something for us to eat, and to
keep out of sight as much as possible behind a nearby pile of railroad ties.
When half an hour or more had passed and he had not returned, I began to get
uneasy. I recalled that there were not more than half a dozen houses in the
place, and probably no store; but presently he returned with a loaf of homemade
bread, sliced and buttered, several hard-boiled eggs, and two large slices of
fried ham, all wrapped up in a piece of newspaper. There was a barrel of fresh
water directly under the water tank's movable supply pipe, and with lenty to
drink, we soon consumed all of the food.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, an eastbound passenger
train had come through. It did not stop, but about ten P.M. an eastbound
freight stopped for water and we climbed into an empty box car and soon were on
our way. We did not sleep much that night, for whenever the train came to a
stop, Curly would open up the side door on the station side and watch toward
each end of the train to see if a shack was coming to search the train. If one
did show up-- their swinging lanterns could be seen for quite a distance-- we
would jump to the ground, close the door, hide until the shack had passed, and
then reenter the car.<p>

<p>
Around four in the morning we came to
a town of some size. I have forgotten the name, but it was a railroad junction
and probably a division point, for I recall seeing a switch engine or two and a
number of railroad tracks. We left the train there and walked to the depot,
where we washed up. From there, Curly led me to a nearby stream where we
encountered a couple of other tramps he knew, and to whom he introduced me as
&quot;Young Curly&quot;. We cleared a new place in the jungle of brush and
weeds, lay down side by side, and slept till about noon.</p>

<p>
Curly was sitting up and talking to
the other tramps when I awoke, and presently we were squatting around a small
fire, on the embers of which was a five-gallon kerosine can half-filled with
the most delicious stew I had ever eaten. It contained potatoes, canned
tomatoes, and pieces of beef, mutton, and chicken. There was plenty of bread,
and each served himself by dipping empty tomato cans into the boiling stew, retrieving
potatoes and meat with the aid of a paddle-shaped stick. It was my first
&quot;mulligan: but had I known that it was my stolen money that provided all
but the &quot;gump&quot; (chicken), which of course was stolen, I might not
have felt so elated.</p>

<p>
When we had finished eating and the
cans had been scoured out with sand from the banks of the nearby stream and
secreted in the bushes near the fire, the other two tramps went away. Curly
produced two packs of cigarettes, gave one to me with a box of matches, and proceeded
to teach me the tricks of the trade. He first told me that every boy of my age
tramping about the country was liable to be assaulted and badly mistreated --
 sometimes even killed -- unless he had a &quot;Jocker&quot;.  He explained
that he was going to be my Jocker (protector or road father) and that as long
as I did what he asked of me, he would let no one harm me. He warned me not to
talk to other tramps except in his presence, intimating that they might lie to
me about him for the purpose of getting me to leave him for them. I really
liked Curly and promised I would obey him.</p>

<p>
Curly then advised me about stealing.
He told me never to steal anything from a person's house when I was asked in to
sit for a meal. He explained that sooner or later I would be caught and sent to
jail. It was alright, he explained, to steal chickens, fruits and vegetables
from farmers. He taught me his method of catching chickens, which was to start
walking toward the fowl until it started to run, and then to follow it just
fast enough to keep it running, but not fast enough to make it break into
flight. He explained that the chicken would keel over from exhaustion by the
time it had run a few hundred feet, whereas if forced into flight it would
probably never be caught. Many times, in later years, I proved his theory to be
reliable.</p>

<p>
Having
ascertained that I knew nothing of begging, Curly explained what he considered
to be the best approach, and rehearsed me in the stories I was to tell. One was
that when I was &quot;Chronicking&quot; (begging from private homes)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">á </span>the best story to tell was that my parents
had died and that I was making my way to an aunt in New York, or elsewhere. If
I was asked in to a meal and I was hungry I was to accept; but if not hungry,
to ask to have some food put in a bag so that I might share it with another boy
who was going with me. Begging on the streets of a city or good-sized town was
another matter entirely. Here, I was told, the best story consisted of telling
pedestrians, to the accompaniment of tears, that I had just dropped a quarter
or half-dollar down a crack in the sidewalk (nearly all sidewalks were wooden
then), and ask the pedestrian to help me find it. I was to explain that my
father had sent me to buy some food and that I would get a terrific whipping if
I returned home without it.</p>

<p>
That worked succesfully when I
tried it out in Louisville, KY. a few days later, but in one case it proved a
ludicrous boomerang. I had told the story to an elderly gentleman who was very
sympathetic. After searching in vain for the half dollar I said I had lost, the
old man asked me what I had been told to buy. Without thinking, I said, &quot;A
sack of cornmeal.&quot; Thereupon, the old gentleman led me across the street
to a grocery and bought the meal for me, and made me a gift of the fifty-five
cents change he received from a dollar. Cornmeal was not worth much at the
time, for I received a fifty-pound sack; and to make matters worse, the old
gent insisted on seeing that I got safely home with it.
So I got it on my shoulder and started down
the street, looking for an open house door where I could get rid of my burden.
I finally spied one across the street and, thanking my benefactor, crossed the
street, climbed the dozen or so
stairs, and entered a short hall where I sat the sack down gently. I waited a
couple of minutes until the old gentleman had passed on, then ran down the
steps and walked hurriedly to the corner-- where I met Curly, who had seen the
whole thing. What the people thought when they found the sack of meal in their
hall, I can't imagine.</p>

<p>
Curly told me that when begging it was wise to have
but little, if any, money in my pocket at the time, because if I was arrested
and had money I would probably be considered a professional beggar and be given
ten or more days in jail. On the other
hand, if I had no money on me, I could expect to be given a twenty-four hour
&quot;floater&quot; to get out of town. For that reason, he would follow me on
my begging excursions and collect from me after each touch I made. He told me
that if I wanted money for anything he would gladly give it to me, and I
believed him. He also instructed me never to beg private houses when the men
were apt to be at home for, as he explained, women were more tender-hearted and
didn't ask so many damn fool questions. I learned a lot from Curly that
afternoon.</p>

<p>
About four o'clock Curly led me to
the outskirts of the town and told me to beg at some of the houses for food. I
did so, and at the very first house I got a &quot;sitdown&quot; (invitation to
the kitchen table) and was given a quarter besides. At the next house I fared
even better when I told of my supposed boy companion. The kind lady made up a
lot of sandwiches, added a quartered pie and half a cake, and packed it all
neatly into a large paper bag. She cried over me, kissed my cheeks, gave me two
half-dollars, and finally sent me on my way with God's blessing. I felt ashamed
to think how I had deceived her.</p>

<p>
Curly met me a block or so away and
we repaired to the jungle. The other two tramps did not return that evening
and, as there had been two tomato cans full of mulligan left over from the noon
meal, we had more than enough food for supper and breakfast. Curly went uptown
and bought some coffee, and brought back some old newspapers for bedding. He
taught me how to build a safe >fire,
after which he warmed up the rest of the mulligan and made coffee. After dinner
he packed the rest of the food in the paper bag and tied the top securely to
keep out insects. Then he hid out the food, placed the large oil can over it
for added protection, and weighted it down with a large rock.</p>

<p>
We left the jungle and its mosquitoes
to find shelter for the night. We located a large pile of new railroad ties
nearby, from which he constructed a leanto. It was just wide enough for both of
us to lie comfortably side by side, and after Curly had spread out the
newspapers we crawled under the ties and lay there talking for an hour or more
before going to sleep.</p>
