Chapter 10</b></p>

<p>
A few days later, Baldy and I
started for California. We stopped at a number of small towns en route to
Houston, went to Galveston for a week or more, and then to San Antonio.
I had not been feeling well for several days.
One morning a pleasant-faced, middle-aged woman, whom I had begged for
food, was preparing a meal for me as I sat at her kitchen table when suddenly I
had a chill and my teeth began to chatter. She knew what was the matter and
insisted that I go into a small bedroom off the kitchen, take off my clothes,
and go to bed. She called a doctor, who told me I had malaria and prescribed
quinine in large doses. She nursed me through my illness, which lasted about
ten days. Her name was Mrs. Boyd, and she ran a boarding house. When I asked
her why she was so considerate of me, a total stranger, she told me that her
sister had a boy about my age who had become a tramp; but from the way she
cried when she spoke of him I have always been inclined to believe he was her
own son. I stayed on for several days doing chores for her; and the morning I
left, I placed a twenty- and a ten-dollar bill under a plate on the kitchen
table. Going into the parlor where she was sweeping, I bade her goodbye and
thanked her for what she had done for me. She cried a bit, kissed me on the
cheek, and closed the door softly after me as I went down the steps. I'm sure
she watched me from the parlor window until I was out of sight. I wrote to her
from Denver several times, and she wrote to me. About three years later I
received a joyful letter from her telling me that her &quot;sister's boy&quot;
had returned home a year previously, gotten married, and settled down. What a
grand world this would be, I thought, if there were more Mrs. Boyds in it!</p>

<p>
Although it was winter, it was
quite warm in San Antonio. When I went into the barroom of the Hotel Maverick
for my favorite drink, a tall glass of lemonade, I saw above the bar a pair of
steer horns that amazed me. The bartender told me that they measured 12 feet
from tip to tip, but I think that he stretched it a foot or two.I went to the
Alamo Plaza and saw the historic adobe in which Sam Houston was beseiged, and
then went on a hunt for Baldy. I was unable to locate him, and concluded that
he had gone on to California alone. Instead of following him, I decided to go
home to Denver and spend the rest of the winter with my mother. It is only five
or six hundred miles from San Antonio to Denver, but I was more than two weeks
in making it. A blizzard struck the Texas panhandle, and I was snowed in at
Quanah and again at Childress. At each of these towns I had to remain
several days while the snowplows cleared the tracks.</p>

<p>
I stayed at Denver until spring,
and then went East again. I didn't like begging as well as peddling, and as the
phoney jewelry racket was played out, I ventured into the patent medicine line.
I had encountered a man who was selling a &quot;Magic Catarrh Cure&quot;, one
whiff of which would cause violent sneezing. I bought a bottle and took it to a
druggist to find out what it contained, and he told me it was oil of mustard or
oil of horseradish, he didn't know which. Samples of each, which he let me
smell, seemed to be identical in potency. As the oil of mustard was the
cheaper,I bought a small quantity, as well as two dozen corked glass vials and
a pint of alcohol. I put ten drops of the oil into each vial and filled them
with alcohol. The mixture resembled the sample that I had bought from the
peddler, except that mine was cloudy. I took a good sniff of one of the vials,
and it nearly knocked me over. I experimented with weaker solutions, and
finally hit on the expedient of putting two drops of the oil into an empty vial
and then stuffing the vial with absorbent cotton. This worked fine; one could
take a good sniff at the mouth of the vial without pain, though it would still
cause tears to flow. I made up a better spiel than the peddler
had given me, as I guaranteed that my
product would cure not only catarrh but coughs, colds, hay fever, influenza,
and laryngitis.</p>

<p>
I worked hard all day the first
day and sold only six or seven vials at fifty cents each, but I learned two
things -- one, that I was charging too much, and the second, that my product
needed a label; two labels, in fact, one bearing the name of the product and the
second, directions for its use. I decided to plunge. and had a
thousand labels printed which read:<BR>
DR. CARVER'S<BR>
Cough,Cold, and Catarrh Cure<BR>
Price, One Dollar</p>

<p>
I also had a thousand labels printed which gave directions
for use; I think my printing bill came to four dollars. The one-ounce vials
were too small, and I bought a gross of two-ounce square-shouldered dark brown
bottles which gave my white labels outstanding prominence.</p>

<p>
I filled
and labeled two dozen bottles and went across the river to Kansas City, Kansas,
where I sold them all in about five hours, getting fifty cents for a few and
twenty-five cents each for the rest. The &quot;Price, One Dollar&quot; on the
label was a big factor in promoting sales, especially among the negroes, to
whom most of my sales were made. I was glad to have found a promising racket
again, and stuck around Kansas City for two weeks. No one bothered me, and I
even sold some of my stuff to policemen. At that time, few cities had laws
regulating peddlers, and the Pure Food and Drugs Act was unheard of. I dressed
well, bought a handsome leather case that would hold six or seven dozen of my
bottles, and confined my operations to the larger towns. I sold to all classes,
in stores, offices, and homes, where- and whenever I could find somebody to
listen to my spiel and sniff my cureall. People in those days judged the
potency of a medicine by its taste or odor; the more disagreeable it was, the
more potent it was considered to be. I represented myself as being a direct
agent of Dr. Carver, who had the welfare of humanity at heart in permitting his
product to be sold at less than the established price. <A name="alice22" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice22">I varied that statement
with others which I thought equally convincing, and became a first-class
salesman, plus one hell of a liar.</A> At any rate, I unconsciously acquired an
insight into the psychology of selling, which proved handy in later years.</p>

<p>
Though I
traveled alone and on the cushions most of the time, I did not neglect my
tramping friends. I sought them at known tramp hangouts and in the jungles,
where I liberally shared my earnings with them just because I liked them. Why?
God knows. Most of them were drunken sots; yet many of them, when sober, gave
evidence of having been well educated, and a few were the intellectual equals
of any man I have ever known. Practically all were introverts, and few ever
spoke of their earlier lives.</p>

<p>
That
summer I worked all over the midwestern states, and In August I started south
again. In Cairo I sold nearly one hundred bottles in a day when I came across
about three hundred negroes who were repairing damage done to the banks of the
river by flood waters the previous spring. The people of Memphis, Nashville,
Vicksburg, and Mobile, both white and black, bought freely, and when I reached
New Orleans I had saved nearly a thousand dollars, most of which I sent to
mother. I covered all the larger towns in Texas and then went to Mexico, making
all of the principal cities but few sales. The Germans were my best customers,
as most of them understood English. From Mexico City I went to Vera Cruz, where
I secured passage on a two-masted coastal lugger that took me to Aransas Pass,
Texas. From there I went by rail to San Antonio; I called at Mrs. Boyd's home,
but was told that she was away on a visit for a few days.</p>

<p>
I went to
El Paso, and a day or two later I encountered the meanest man I have ever met.
It was in May of 1893 when I left El Paso at night en route to California. I
was riding on a freight train, and when it made its first stop to take on water
a shack spotted me and I was ditched. There was a telegraph station there, and
when I asked the operator what time the next train would come through, he
didn't answer but came out of the office with a revolver in his hand and
ordered me to get going down the tracks. I started walking west, but stopped at
the water tank about seventy-five feet from the station to get a drink. I
didn't get it. I hadn't been stopped for more than a few seconds when I heard
myself being called all the so-and-so's in creation, and then I heard the
report of a gun being fired. I started running, stumbled and fell, got up and
ran again. When I had gone about two hundred yards I remembered that I had left
my sample case beside the water tank, but I didn't go back for it.</p>

<p>
I think it
was about midnight when I started walking, and it was hot. I had lacerated my
hands and knees when I fell, and my knees hurt at every step; but I kept on
through the night, hoping to come to a town where I could find relief. I found
none, and by nine or ten o'clock I fell beside the tracks, unable to take
another step. It was insufferably hot, and the sun seemed to draw every bit of
moisture out of my body. There was no shade anywhere except for that afforded
by a two-foot pile of railroad ties close by. I managed to reach them, but was
too weak to lift and place them in a position to form a shelter. I lay beside
them and watched a couple of trains
pass, but was unable to signal them, and I doubt if they would have stopped had
I done so.</p>

<p>
When the
sun went down, a breeze sprang up and it turned cooler. I got to my feet and
sat on the ties for an hour or so and then started walking again, but I was so
stiff and lame that every step was agony. I kept going at a snail's pace, and
about one o'clock in the morning I had to stop and rest. I must have gone to
sleep, for I awoke about an hour later to the crash of thunder and it began to
rain heavily. That rain saved my life. My tongue was sore and swollen, my feet
were so badly swollen that I had to cut away most of the uppers of my shoes,
and I am sure that another day in the blazing sun would have finished me. I
soaked a clean handkerchief in the rain and squeezed water into my mouth, but I
couldn't seem to get enough of it.</p>

<p>
The rain
didn't last long, but it freshened me and I started on again. About six o'clock
I saw a small frame shack not far from the tracks, and made my way to it. A
couple of dogs came at me on the run, barking and snarling, but thank God they
didn't bite, for I could have offered no resistance. A Mexican woman came to
the door of the shack and, seeing my condition, led me inside and made me lie
down on an old mattress placed on the floor. She gave me water and later a
tortilla, but I couldn't eat it; my mouth was too sore. I slept most of the day
and when I awakened, she gave me more water and some goat's milk. She could
speak only a few words of English, but I gathered that her husband was a
sheepherder. If so, he must have had his sheep at some distance from where he
lived, for ten square miles of that God-forsaken desert couldn't have pastured
more than a dozen sheep.</p>

<p>
The dogs
became friendly, and I petted them. I learned that Deming, New Mexico was only
about three miles away, and about six o'clock I decided to get going again. I
offered the woman a five-dollar bill,
but she wouldn't accept it, nor would she take a smaller amount. When I urged
it upon her, she put her hands behind her back and seemed to be angry, turning
loose a torrent of Spanish to show her displeasure. When I said &quot;muchas
gracias&quot; and offered my hand, she smiled and shook hands with me, and I
left her standing in the doorway as I resumed my journey.</p>

<p>
I was much
stronger now, and although quite lame I reached Deming about nine o'clock,
where I went to a hotel and sent for a doctor. I managed a bath, with the
porter's assistance, and when the doctor came he dressed my lacerated hands and
knees, put me on a milk and raw egg diet, and told me to stay in bed for
several days. He charged me only two dollars for his call and bandages, and
seemed to do that reluctantly. What a different world today!</p>

<p>
I stayed
in Deming about a week. I was unable to buy what I required to make up more of
my catarrh remedy there, so I headed for Phoenix, Arizona via freight and blind
baggage. At Maricopa Junction I bought a ticket over the jerk line to Phoenix.
I was unable to get what I wanted there, but I met two prospectors who were
going to the Hassayampa River, about fifty miles north of Phoenix, to try and
locate some placer mines. They painted such a glowing picture of their chances
of finding hidden pockets of gold that I decided to go with them.</p>

<p>
One of
them lacked about fifty dollars of having enough for his outfit, so I loaned it
to him. I also spent about a hundred dollars on my outfit, which included a
burro and a 30-30 Savage rifle. I knew we had about forty miles of desert to
cross, but despite my recent experience it held no terrors for me; my two
companions were old desert rats who had been over the trail several times before.
We did most of our traveling in the early morning and late evening, as it was
very hot in the daytime. There were water holes about every ten miles except
for one stretch of twenty miles of very sandy desert, which we crossed in one
night.</p>

<p>
We were
four days making the trip. The Hassayampa River was smaller than I had imagined
it would be, although the river bed was large enough to carry twenty times as
much as water as was in it. Mat, the oldest of my two companions, told me that
in March and April the river overflowed its banks.</p>

<p>
We went
upstream about three miles from where we first struck the river and made camp
under a clump of aspen trees. There was plenty of good grazing land between the
river and the nearby mountains, and for the first few days we hobbled our
burros and turned them loose. After a few days, hobbling was no longer
necessary; burros seldom wander more than a mile from a human habitation, and
invariably return to it at nightfall.</p>

<p>
Mat and
John, the younger man, took me down to the river at the mouth of a gully that
emptied into it, and taught me how to wash sand and gravel in a gold pan. I was
clumsy at first, but soon got the knack of swishing the water around in the pan
without washing out the black sand. They had a six-foot steel bar whci they
drove down into the sand, trying to locate bedrock, on top of which the richer
sands were to be found. When they didn't strike bedrock at fouf feet, they
would pull out the bar and try another spot.</p>

<p>
After
several tries. they located a ledge about three feet down. We set to work with
shovels and dug a hole to within six inches of the rock, where the gravel began
to get coarser. We shoveled as much of the coarse sand and gravel as we could
get into our three pans, and went to the river to pan them out. When the coarse
gravel was removed by hand, we panned the balance down to black sand, and I was
delighted to see small flecks of gold scattered here and there through
the sand. We picked the gold out of the sand
with fine tweezers. There wasn't much, the largest piece being about half the
size of a grain of wheat. Mat weighed all that we had recovered on a small
balance, and estimated that our combined take was about a dollar and a quarter.
As we had already put in over two hours' hard work digging and panning, it was
a foregone conclusion that we wouldn't get rich at that rate; so we tried
another gulch, where we had a little better luck.</p>

<p>
I stayed
with them until August, when my supplies ran out, and then started out for
Prescott with one-third of our take. I sold it in Prescott for two hundred
twenty dollars. I figured I had averaged about three dollars a day for actual
time worked, but I was not disappointed; I had enjoyed the life in the open,
and I resolved to return there the following summer. I didn't ask John for the
return of the fifty dollars I had loaned him, nor did he offer it when we said
goodbye. I think he had forgotten it entirely. At any rate, I counted the
experience I had gained as being worth it, for I had formed a theory regarding
dry gulch placer mining which was borne out in practice later. I cached my
tools along the trail to the Congress mine and rode my burro to Prescott, where
I sold it for five dollars more than it had cost me.</p>

<p>
I reached
Denver in the latter part of August and stayed with my mother for a few days,
after which I jumped to Chicago to see the World's Fair. Two weeks of that
sufficed me, and I returned to Denver and worked at barbering until the
following March. Then I lit out for Prescott again, determined to put the
theory I had evolved into practice.</p>

<p>
I had
noticed the previous summer that the farther we got from the river, the richer
the pockets became; also, the depth of sand to bedrock was considerably less.
It was out of the question to carry the scrapings from a bedrock ledge to the
river by hand, so I took with me half a dozen canvas ore sacks. I bought two
burros at Prescott, paying ten dollars more for each than I had received for
the first one. I packed all the grub I could onto one of the burros and rode
the other, as it was about eighty miles to the river. I picked up the tools I
had cached and made the Hassayampa in about five days, where I made camp at the
same spot Mat had picked the year before. The river was quite high this time,
and at first I feared that a cloudburst in the mountains might wash me out; but
a glance across the river reassured me, for it was a good
twenty feet lower than the bank I was on.</p>

<p>
I had
arrived too early to work the gulches I had worked before, as they were still
carrying off melted snow from the mountains. The days were pleasant and the
nights cold, so I just played lazy Indian for about six weeks, watching myself
and the burros grow fat and occasionally riding one of them into the hills in
search of outcroppings of gold-bearing ore.</p>

<p>
When the
first of the gullies became dry enough to work, I rode about a mile toward the
hills and started prospecting for bedrock. I found a place where a ledge of
rock crossed the gully, and it was not more than two feet from the surface. I
dug a large hole down to the ledge, but was disappointed to find that it sloped
toward the river. That meant that but little gold would be found in the surface
gravel for the gold, being heavier than its sand, would move downstream until it
met an obstruction, behind which it would lodge in a &quot;pocket&quot;. I
spent a backbreaking day trying to locate a rise in the ledge, withoug success.
I finally filled two ore sacks with sand and gravel from the surface of the
ledge, loaded them onto the burro, and returned to camp. I panned them out the
next morning, securing about two dollars worth of gold dust.</p>

<p>
I followed
the same procedure throughout the summer. In one gulch I found three small
pockets from which I panned about three hundred dollars worth of gold, and when
I returned to Prescott in September I sold a little over six hundred dollars
worth of dust. I had had to go to Congress twice for food, at which times I met
other prospectors who were not doing nearly as well as I had done. I had at least
proved my theory correct. I sold my burros, taking a twenty-dollar loss, gave
my tools to an old prospector, and returned to Denver as a paid passenger.
</p>

<p><A name="alice23" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice23">
I remained
in and around Denver for the next four years. I learned the machinist,
painting, and steam-fitting trades, at which I worked most of the time.</A> I also
tried several other occupations, one being motorman and conductor on the
Montclair branch of the Denver Tramway Company. I thought I was through with
tramping for the rest of my life and intended to settle down and get married;
but these intentions proved to be another case of &quot;The best-laid plans of
mice and men...&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>
I had
learned to dance during that period, and I must have fallen in and out of love
with at least half a dozen girls. I had, and took advantage of, every
opportunity to prove that what Judge Ben Lindsay said about the immorality of
Denver's young women was true. I think he underestimated the proportion of
those that could be had for the asking, but I don't think that Denver was any
worse than other cities in that respect; he just happened to be in a
self-created position to uncover such indiscretions, and did not hesitate to
tell his constituents about them. By far most of the girls were seeking
marriage, and took that loose means of attaining their ends. That they were
eventually successful is beyond question, and I haven't a doubt that most of
them made excellent wives.</p>

<p>
In January of 1898 I fell hard for the
daughter of a railroad man. She was a very pretty brunette, shapely, and with a
superabundance of what the world now calls &quot;it&quot;. We went together for
about three months. Although I had good reason to know that she was not a
virgin, I was so much in love with her that I proposed marriage, to which she
gladly consented. She set the wedding day for the first week in June and
although our relations were intimate, I impatiently awaited the day I could
legally call her my own. I shall refer to her here as Ella (not her real name).
</p>

<p>
About the
middle of May I was sent to install some mining machinery at a mine near
Central City, where I expected to stay ten days. When I got there I found that
the heavy cast iron base of one of the machines
machines had become cracked in shipping. As it would mean a week's delay in
getting another I returned to Denver, where I arrived about 8 P. M. I went
home, cleaned up and changed clothes, and then phoned the D. &amp; R.G.
Railroad Company's dispatcher to find out if my sweetheart's father was at
home. I learned he was at Pueblo and would not return until noon the next day.
He was a widower, and Ella kept house for him. She had given me a key to the
front door so that I could slip into her room on the nights her father was
away, and I did so this night at about ten o'clock. I tiptoed to her room in order
to surprise her, and succeeded admirably. When I snapped on her bedroom light,
what I saw drove me into a furious rage. I pulled her companion out of the bed
and pounded him unmercifully with my fists. I let go of him and straddled
Ella's body with my knees on the bed, while I cuffed her face from side to side
with my open hands. I was crying and calling her every unmentionable name I had
ever heard. She didn't cry out, but lay there glaring at me with hatred in her
blazing black eyes. for a minute or two, and then burst into tears and begged
me to forgive her. I still sat astride her, and suddenly I broke into
uncontrollable laughter. I felt weak and lay down beside her and laughed
spasmodically until I became exhausted and fell asleep with her body close to
mine and her arm under my head.</p>

<p>
That sleep
probably kept me from going insane. When I awoke at daylight I had a terrific
headache and every bone and muscle in my body ached. She told me that her boy
friend had left when I started slapping her. I thought I had killed him and
would find him on the floor beside the bed, and was relieved to know he was
alive. She told me that he had seduced her a year before, and that he had
pleaded so hard for one last embrace before our marriage that she hadn't the heart
to refuse him. She told me that she loved only me and God knows I wanted to
believe her, but I couldn't when I recalled the hatred in her eyes when I
slapped her. I left her in tears and went home and told the unlovely story to
my mother, who did her best to console me. For several days I was on the verge
of making up with the girl I loved, and once had the urge to commit suicide.
Mother was worried for fear I would do something desperate, and fed me large
doses of potassium bromide to calm my nerves. She suggested that I go on a
tramping trip again, and the next day I left for California to resume a
tramping career that lasted for nearly five years without interrruption. <A name="alice24" HREF="../Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice24">Better
