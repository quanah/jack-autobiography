Chapter 14</b></p>

<p>
Before writing finis to this tale of my life, I desire
to supplement what has gone before with a few
observations on the habits and customs of tramps, and to comment briefly
on one or two other matters.</p>

<p>
Where I have
used the word &quot;tramp&quot; in this narrative, it is to designate those who
depend solely upon begging, peddling, and the theft of food and clothing for a
livelihood. Burglars, robbers and other thieves who infrequently associate with
tramps are a class about which I know but little. As a rule, they only take to
tramping as a means of hiding out temporarily, and though if known they are
accepted as members of the clan, the wiser tramps shun their society as much as
possible.</p>

<p>
Hoboes and
gaycats are definitely not tramps. The hobo is a migratory worker who makes use
of the same means of transportation as the tramp, as does the gaycat. Gaycats
are migratory thieves and beggars who seldom share their spoils with anybody.
They are the ones who commit practically all the petty thefts attributed to
tramps in the smaller towns and cities, and real tramps despise them.</p>

<p>
Since I began to
write these reminiscences of my life in Trampdom, I learned that several books
on the subject have been published, and I secured those available at the Oakland
Public Library and read them. Of those I have read in which the authors claim
to have related their actual experiences, only one-- &quot;Tramping with
Tramps&quot;, by Josiah Flynt--bears evidence that the writer knew much about
his subject. Even Mr. Flynt, whose experience antedated mine, was unable to get
far below the surface of Trampdom, principally because he was motivated by the
sole desire to gain information from which to compile sociological data. One
has to be a tramp in body, mind and soul to really know them. With all my
experience among them, I do not think that I know them fully. From a
psychological standpoint, they are one of the most complex groups of society.
</p>

<p>
One writer in
particular amused me when I read his book relating his experiences in Trampdom.
The writer is a distinguished author in other fields, and styles himself
&quot;A Tramp Royal.&quot; In his book, presumably written in serious vein, he
writes in great detail of his life on the road and gives word-for-word accounts
of his conversations with various people. What a prodigious memory he must have
had! He devotes more than five thousand words to an account of how he outwitted
the entire crew of a passenger train--five men--by methods even the
dullest-minded of tramps would scorn to use. He tells of running time after
time, at station after station, from the front of the train to a point ahead of
the engine, where he boarded the blind baggage each time after the shack had of
necessity dropped off to catch a coach further back. Even the veriest tyro
among tramps, when he finds that the shacks have spotted him trying to ride the
blind, knows enough to drop back to the middle of the train unseen, go into a
coach, sit down and wait until the train is well under way. He then merely goes
to the platform of the car, stands upon the handrail, and climbs to the deck, a
comparatively easy feat for an experienced tramp. There is little likelihood
that the conductor will spring the tramp in the second or third coach, for the
cons start their round of collecting tickets in the first car. Should a shack
pass through the car in which the tramp is sitting, it is unlikely that he will
be discovered, for shacks rarely notice the passengers and they certainly don't
stop in the performance of their duties to count noses. On several occasions
when pulling this
stunt, I have met shacks in the coaches or on the platforms
and by simply meeting them face to face and
walking past them as a passenger would do, I have gained my ends. Shacks rarely
get close enough to the tramp they are trying to outwit to be able to recognize
him even in a brightly lighted coach. The tramp sees to that, for he seldom is
out in the lighted spaces where he can be seen and identified.</p>

<p>
When a tramp
finds he can't ride the blind, he has another ace in the hole besides
&quot;swinging under&quot;. As the train pulls out, he gets onto the lower step
of the front end of a coach, and with both hands clinging to the step handles
nearest to the body of the coach he swings his body out of sight alongside the
coach until he thinks the way is clear, and then hits the deck. Should a shack
pass from one coach to another while the tramp is clinging to the step handle
the tramp will not likely be discovered, for the shack is too intent on keeping
his hips from being bruised by the handrails as the cars lurch from side to
side. Should he be discovered, however, he is in a precarious position, for the
shack can kick at him. In that event, the knowing tramp quickly swings himself
forward, grabs the step handles of the forward car, and is up and onto the
platform before the shack realizes what is happening. They are then on an equal
footing, where they can fight it out if necessary. The tramp's chief stock in
trade is a nimble wit.</p>

<p>
In passing, I
will add that shacks are seldom so zealous in keeping tramps off trains that
they will risk being injured or killed while doing so. Before the advent of air
brakes, shacks carried &quot;Paddy-sticks&quot; (usually sledgehammer handles),
which they used to obtain leverage when tightening brakes, or for lifting
coupling links
into the best position for effective coupling of the cars. The paddy-stick also
served as a formidable weapon, but since the advent of air brakes and automatic
couplers they are no longer used. Shacks knew that some of their passengers
were desperate characters, and when a tramp displayed unusual determination to
ride, the wiser shacks let him alone.</p>

<p>
But
to return to our self-styled &quot;Tramp Royal&quot;-- at one place in his
story he tells how tramps on the rods are sometimes killed when the shack
lowers a coupling pin, with ball cord attached, between the ends of two cars,
and manipulates it in such a manner that it will bounce up and knock the tramp
off the rods - this while the train is rolling sixty miles an hour. One infers
that the practice of doing so was not unusual on what he terms &quot;bad
roads&quot;. That story might serve to dissuade a six-year-old child from
becoming a tramp, but the absurdity of it should be patent to any thinking
person, and I surely cannot be the first to point it out.</p>

<p>
To begin with,
if a ten- to fifteen-pound coupling pin were used in the manner described, from
a train traveling &quot;sixty miles&quot; per hour the strain on the free end
of the ball cord would be sufficient either to break the cord or tear it out of
the shack's hands -- unless he were foolish enough to wrap it around them, in
which case his hands would be broken. One must also consider that on one of its
rebounds, the pin will sooner or later lodge momentarily between two ties. The
force of the resulting pull on the cord would make the cord holder wish he'd
never been born.  Further,
what is to prevent the coupling pin from lodging under one of the wheels?
Nothing. And if it did so, there would be grave danger of derailing at least
the rear end of the train, for once a wheel flange is lifted to or above the
top of a rail, the least sidesway of the trucks, or the swing of a curve in the
rails, would be sufficient to derail the train. Shacks have too much regard for
their own lives to attempt anything so foolhardy. Besides, they would be
discharged immediately if such a practice were known to their superiors. The
whole story is a libel on shacks and a reflection on the intelligence of
anybody who reads and believes it.</p>

<p>
In another part of this author's tale, he tells how
one can get away from anybody who grabs one by the coat collar in such a manner
that the grabber's hand or fingers are between the collar and one's body. All
one has to do is to twist one's body repeatedly under the grasper's arm, whereupon
&quot;. . . the blood will be bursting out of his finger ends, the delicate
tendons will be rupturing, and all the muscles and nerves will be mashing and
crushing together in a shrieking mess.&quot; His method is based on the
principle of a tourniquet, but he neglects to tell us that in the meantime hiw
own larynx will be flatter than a pancake, his jugular vein will be so
surprised it will forget to function, and long before the grabber's hand begins
to bleed, the grabee will be unconscious. Another thing he forgot to mention
was where in hell he buys his coats, with their superlative buttons and
buttonholes. I would like to own one.</p>

<p>
At yet another
point this author writes that he spent &quot;two weeks&quot; in Washington, D.
C., &quot;trying to beg a pair of shoes&quot; without success. Even a gaycat
could do better than that; and what tramp would be so wasteful of his precious
time, when he would know that all he had to do was to beg a shoestore for a
pair of the half-worn shoes that so many customers leave behind when buying new
ones? Or, the tramp would stand outside a well-patronized shoestore and mooch
for shoes from those men who emerge from the store wearing new shoes and
carrying their old ones in a neatly wrapped shoebox. One such might even be so
philanthropically minded as to take the tramp into the store and buy him a new
pair. It has happened. Failing that, all a tramp would have to do would be to
mooch a few homes, where in the closets of most of them one or more pairs of
old shoes have been thrown merely because the tenants were too busy to carry
them out to the trash can. What a
&quot;Tramp Royal&quot; he proved to be!</p>

<p>
I can't resist
recording this one, where this writer says he walked &quot;forty miles&quot;
and &quot; interviewed the housewives of a thousand homes&quot; -- all within a
space of &quot;<b>ten&quot;</b> (count
them) hours. That works out to an interview every thirty- seven seconds. What a
man!</p>

<p>
I
have not exposed the preposterous nature of the above author's fairy tales
because of any &quot;holier than thou&quot; complex, but merely to show that the
best and worst of human beings sometimes swindle the public by selling phoney
things of one kind or another, and to affirm that the man who once said
&quot;all men are liars&quot; knew what he was talking about.</p>

<p>
Thirty-five
years does not seem to have changed the conditions under which tramps live and
thrive, if I can believe an old tramp, &quot;Yonkers&quot; whom I met in San
Francisco about two years ago. I was looking at a shoe window display when he
mooched me and his face, though lined by age, was so familiar that as I
listened to his spiel I had no difficulty in placing him. I asked him if he
wasn't the Yonkers Kid and he pretended he didn't understand me. However, when
I added that I was Chicago Curly, he admitted his identity. 
I had met him
when he was the punk of the old original Yonkers. He was about eighteen at the
time of our first meeting, but except for age his features had changed but
little. We had lunch together, and a good two hours' chin over old times. From
him I learned that many of my old cronies were dead, including Michael J. and
Tony. I gathered that conditions on the road were much the same as when I had
left it except that the gaycat population had multiplied
tenfold. When I left him I gave him what
little money I had with me, and asked him to remember me to any of the old
bunch he might meet in his ramblings.</p>

<p>
Recently,
I read Thomas Minehan's book, &quot;Boy and Girl Tramps of America&quot; and
found it most interesting, as it covers a phase of tramp life unknown thirty
years ago. In the old days there were but few women on the road and of these,
only one--&quot;Kansas City Kate&quot;--was generally known to and accepted as
one of them by other tramps. I met her; she was about 30 years old and
masculine in build and features. She was not pretty, but what one calls
&quot;nice-looking&quot;. She wore her hair &quot;chippy&quot; style --cut
short and curled with an iron. Her clothing consisted of divided skirts, black
shirtwaist, jacket, and shoes, and a cloth cap. She asked no favors of other
tramps because of her sex. She did her share of the work, often sewed on
buttons and mended the clothes of her companions, and could beg more handouts
in an hour than most tramps could in two. On her foraging trips she usually
collected a few dimes, which she contributed to the general pot. She wouldn't
touch whiteline or beer, but was an inveterate cigarette smoker. She bestowed
her favors sparingly upon those whom she knew to be clean and not diseased, but
played no favorites--an unusual trait in a woman.</p>

<p>
I first met Kate
in the jungles at Baker City, Oregon. Michael J., Tony, Portland Red, Washoe
and I were sitting around a fire waiting for a mulligan to finish cooking when
we heard a noise in the brush and looked up to see a woman standing beside a
tree with a large paper bag in her hand. She smiled, rapped on the tree with
her knuckles, and asked if she could join us. Washoe was the only one of us who
knew her and he jumped to his feet, went up to her, and mockingly offered her
his arm as an escort. He introduced her as Kansas City Kate and I was pleased,
for I had long wanted to meet her. The bag she carried contained handouts.</p>

<p>
During the meal,
there was the usual exchange of news regarding the doings of other tramps, and
when the tins were cleared and put away, she asked if any of us played
cribbage. I was the only one who did, and we played for a couple of hours with
a deck of cards and a small cribbage board she fished out of a pocket of her
skirt. She asked me if I was a yegg, and when I told her that I was just an
ordinary tramp, she seemed surprised and remarked that I was the best dressed
tramp she had ever met. She stayed with our group about two weeks, by which
time our original five had increased to twelve or thirteen, an unusually large
number to be found in one &quot;push&quot;. The increase, of course, was due to
Kate's presence among us. She sneaked out one night without saying goodbye, and
within three days our group was reduced to the original five.
</p>

<p>
During
the time she was with us Kate and I took several strolls by ourselves, and I
learned (in confidence) that her monicker &quot;K.C. Kate&quot; was merely a
reversal of her real name, Kate Casey. She told me she was born and raised in
Los Angeles and had never been farther east than Denver. I did not ask why she
was on the road and in all probability she couldn't have told me, any more than
I can tell today why I pursued the same life for so long a time.</p>

<p>
I met Kate again
about a year later. She was with a group of about ten tramps, and told me she
was getting ready to &quot;lam&quot;. I suggested that we lam together, but she
would not consent to that. However, she did tell me where I could find her a
week hence, provided I made it appear to be an unpremeditated meeting., because
she wanted to preserve the legend of strict impartiality she had so carefully
fostered. We took one last stroll together and that was the last time I saw
her, for the affair that led to the kidnapping at Pocatello occurred a few days
later.</p>

<p>
In Edmond
Kelly's &quot;The Elimination of the Tramp&quot;, published in 1908, he writes
of &quot;an army of 500,000 tramps&quot; and claims that in a period of four
years, from
&quot;1901 to 1905&quot;, approximately 24,000 trespassers on railroad property
were killed and 25,000 injured, &quot;most of them tramps&quot;. Were these
figures accurate, our so-called tramp problem would be solved. I am sure that
while I was tramping there were no more than ten thousand bona fide tramps in
the country, and probably not more than half that number of gaycats.</p>

<p>
At the time
mentioned, California in the winter was a Mecca for tramps; yet I had tramped
the state from one end to the other in a period of four weeks or less, stopping
at practically every town and jungle, without encountering more than two
hundred tramps. Assuming that I missed six hundred who were either in jail or
on the go, that makes only eight hundred tramps in a state notorious for the
density of its tramp population. If my estimates are trebled, there remain some
450,000 migratory workers, mistakenly called &quot;tramps&quot;.</p>

<p>
It is my
conviction that this latter class is as essential to the country's economic
life as are those who operate our great industries. Without these migrant
workers, half the farmers in this country would have to abandon their farms and
take to the road.  And at this point I
find myself moralizing on a subject of which I know practically nothing . .
.however, I do want to state that, in my belief, very few of the six thousand
trespassers killed annually were tramps. Tramps seldom take chances when
boarding a train, and they rarely travel when drunk. Until one learns <b>
all</b> the tricks so essential to one's
safety when riding forbidden trains, there is grave danger of being killed or
maimed for life. One does not hand a boy a loaded revolver and tell him that by
pressing the trigger the gun will be discharged, without first giving
instructions on how to load the gun; yet I have seen one gaycat show another
the rods between the truck and axle on which many of them ride, without
cautioning the newcomer never to ride the rear rods of a coach, but to select
the front ones instead. The reason is fairly obvious. When riding the front
rods one has his back to the track, and comparatively little dust and small
rocks are thrown onto the rider; rather, they are sucked away from him. The
rear rods present an entirely different picture. When a train is rambling at
fifty or sixty miles an hour, over a sandy or rocky roadbed, a vacuum is formed
which, together with the unbroken force of the wind generated by the train's
swift motion, picks up sand and pieces of rock. These, like the firing of a
machine gun, are rained upon the hapless victim facing the barrage. His pant
legs are blown to his knees, baring his legs to the pitiless hail. His face and
hands are cut by the blinding sand and pebbles, and he is unable to breathe
without filling his lungs with a fine dust more suffocating than the smoke of a
burning room. It is no wonder that within an hour or so the man's will to live
fails him, and he either smothers or deliberately slips off of his seat to
escape the punishment he can no longer endure.</p>

<p>
In my recent
reading of what are presumed to be true accounts of tramp life, written by men
who for one reason or another claim to have taken up tramping for a time, I
have failed to find a word regarding this ever-present danger of rod-riding to
the inexperienced hobo. Real tramps seldom ride the rods, and I venture to say
that ninety-five per cent of those whose dismembered bodies are found scattered
along the railroad's right of way are hoboes or gaycats who have fallen from
the rods; and of the remaining five per cent, most are in the same category and
took long chances in boarding a train, or fell from the bumpers when drunk. A
few of all classes get killed at times when a train is derailed, but so do
members of the crew and a few passengers. The proper way to ride the rods was
one of the first things Curly
taught me, and when I saw the gaycat showing his companion the rods of a coach
I warned him of the rear-rod danger. I almost laughed when I read one of the
foregoing authors' comments to the effect that railroad officials complain
bitterly of being obliged by law to bury the bodies of the victims of their own
mantraps.</p>

<p>
So far as I
know, little has been written by those with first-hand knowledge regarding the
sexual life of real tramps. Havelock Ellis, in his &quot;Studies in the
Psychology of Sex,&quot; stated that in his opinion fully five percent of all
men, or one in twenty, are homosexuals. In Trampdom I believe that one in forty
would be nearer the mark for, as has been stated, the majority of perverts are
found in the so-called upper classes of society. In Trampdom, the known pervert
(and he is always known) is neither shunned nor over-welcomed. Most tramps
regard him as an unfortunate person upon whom fate played a scurvy trick by
endowing him with the body of a man and the instincts of a woman. At least. he
is not condemned for his unnatural desires. Some tramps welcome his attentions,
most are indifferent, and a few repulse his advances. Such advances, by the
way, are safely made in Trampdom, for tramps never complain to the police;
whereas in civil life, the pervert has to be more cautious, lest somebody
either blackmail him or denounce him to the authorities.</p>

<p>
Most of these
homosexual men practice fellatio; there are few pederasts among them. They seem
to take a keen delight in gratifying their desires by stealth at night on
sleeping men, rather than by open solicitation. Should the sleeper awake during
the pervert's ministrations, it would usually be too late to do anything about
it; and few cared at that stage, thus the pervert often accomplished his
purpose with those who, under other circumstances,would have repulsed him.</p>

<p>
In the larger
cities tramps encounter these perverts on every hand. They are found in all
classes of society, from bellhops to bankers, and are of all races. Like the
tramp, they are clannish and have their own hangouts. These are usually in some
better-class saloon, in the neighborhood of which they solicit on the streets
or in the parks in a discreet and unobtrusive manner. All tramps (and the
police) know the location of these hangouts and some tramps seek the perverts
there, for the confirmed fellatore will usually pay a dollar or two to the one
he fancies.</p>

<p>
In addition to
the perverts among them, and the prushuns--not punks -- the tramp finds an
outlet for his repressed desires in a number of towns where one or more
kindly-disposed women may be found who are known to be charitably inclined. I
have known tramps to boast of their ability to wheedle prostitutes out of half
an hours' free entertainment. I never tried it myself, but I have always known
that most prostitutes were considered to be generous givers to the down and
out. I can't recall that I ever mooched one except once, when I cut across lots
to the back door of a house. I did not suspect the nature of the occupants
until I was invited in for a &quot;sitdown&quot;. Before I left, the madame
gave me four bits and a package of cigarettes - but nothing else.</p>

<p>
Some writers on tramp life have assumed that
the words &quot;punk&quot; and &quot;Prussian&quot;, or &quot;prushun&quot;,
are interchangeable or synonymous terms. This was not true when I was a tramp.
A punk was a boy used solely for the purpose of begging or stealing. A prushun
was a boy used for begging, stealing, and as a means of sexual gratification to
his jocker. I believe the word &quot;prushun&quot; is a variant of the old
terms prunse, prunsing, and prunchon, the first to designate the act itself,
and the second and third in the sense that one might say, &quot;So-and -so is
good prunsing&quot;, or &quot;So-and-so is a good prunchon&quot;. As a rule,
punks despised prushuns and seldom spoke to them.</p>

<p>
A few writers
have asserted that it was the custom for jockers to beat their punks and
prushuns. I did not find it so. In most cases the relationship was more like
that of father and son, and on several occasions I have seen punks display
vicious resentment when disparaging remarks were made about their jockers. Most
of them were little devils in the fights that occurred infrequently in the
jungles or at a hangout.</p>

<p>
Within their own
ranks, the major offences were: snitching or squealing on one anoher to the
police; and the attempt by one tramp to entice the punk or prushun of another
tramp to leave his jocker for the enticer. Even if the punk wanted to leave his
jocker, he would not be able to do so unless the jocker consented to the
transfer. However, incongruous though it may seem, if the favored tramp and the
punk ran away together the group would
take no action against either of them. It was then up to the deserted tramp to
either pursue the runaways or snare himself another punk or prushun. As a punk
could be snared at most any town along the line, the latter was the usual
procedure.</p>

<p>
Stealing from
another tramp, or holding out money on one or another of the group, without
announcing in advance the reason for the holdout, were likewise serious
offences, meriting at least banishment from the particular group with which the
offender might be traveling. One reason for holding out on the group which always
met approval was in case the holdout was made to provide tobacco, or a
mouthpiece (lawyer) for a tramp in jail.</p>

<p>
Tramps have an
unwritten code of ethics which is more strictly adhered to than the code of any
other group I can name. Violation of any of its major tenets is usually
followed by ostracism for life, and the offender becomes a lone wolf shunned by
every tramp who learns of the unethical conduct. The news spreads by word of
mouth and travels fast, for there are always a few tramps who &quot;jump&quot;
from coast to coast within a period of two or three weeks. As each group hears
the story and passes it on it becomes, like all word-of-mouth messages, grossly
exaggerated.</p>

<p>
If the offence
is committed against a member of the group with whom the group usually
associates, each side is given a hearing. The group weighs the evidence and
decides the matter in one of three ways. If the charge is sustained, the
luckless tramp is usually told that a train is leaving in half an hour, bound
in the direction opposite to that in which the group is traveling. If the group
decides that the defendant was wrongly accused, his accuser is given the same
sentence unless extenuating circumstances can be shown. If the group is unable
to decide the guilt or innocence of the
accused, both accused and accuser are admonished to drop the matter and
not to bring it up at any future time, nor to mention the case to others
outside the group. Usually, both parties to the dispute shake hands and forget
about it. Most tramps, being clever liars themselves, can detect the slightest
sign of falsehood in a statement made by either party in question.</p>

<p>
Another major
tenet of Trampdom's code of ethics involves relations with the &quot;outside
world&quot;. Rape or attempted rape, drunk or sober; destruction of property or
premises where a tramp has been refused food or clothing; and abusive or
insulting language to any citizen who refused help; the stealing of
&quot;gooseberries&quot; (clothing) from a clothesline, except in the larger
towns and cities; all are major offenses. In brief, the doing of any act that
would tend to make the citizens of a place hostile to tramps as such; for many
tramps spend over ninety percent of their time in the smaller communities, and
such acts make life more precarious for them.</p>

<p>
I am not sure
Emily Post would approve of Trampdom's simple jungle etiquette. Tramps are
scrupulously clean in the handling of their food, both before and after
cooking. When a meal or mulligan is to be served, newspapers are spread on the
ground. On them are placed bread, broken into chunks; raw onions, apples,
tomatoes, roasting ears (according to season); and what-have-you for desert. If
a mulligan constitutes the sole entree, it is dipped out with a ladle made from
an empty tomato can, around which a piece of heavy wire has been twisted or to
which a stick of wood has been nailed. The self-appointed ladler, usually an
older tramp, does his best to be impartial in dividing the choicer tidbits like
chicken. The older tramps and any newcomers who may be present are served
first, and if one expresses a preference for lean or fat meat the ladler tries
to comply with the request. He uses a piece of wire or a sharpened stick to
spear pieces of meat and when the ladle is full, he pours it into another can
of the same size and hands if to the nearest tramp, who in turn passes it on to
the one whom the ladler has designated as the one to be served first.
</p>

<p>
The
tramp who is served first invariably proffers his can to those sitting on
either side of him, and the offer is invariably declined with thanks; whereupon
he helps himself to a piece of bread and proceeds to dunk out a part of the
liquid, using a small stick to scoop the solid particles into his mouth--in
much the same manner as the Chinese use chopsticks. For second helpings, each
one helps himself. There is always more than enough, but the &quot;After you,
my dear Alphonse&quot; spirit prevails. When the meal is over, all hands help
in washing the utensils which, when clean, are hidden in the underbrush with
the bottoms turned up. Insofar as their own class is concerned, there is
general observance of the Golden Rule.</p>

<p>
Lexicographers,
I am told, are unable to agree on the derivation of the word
&quot;hobo&quot;.  Some seem inclined to
believe that, like Topsy, it &quot;just growed&quot;. One offers a gratuitous
insult to tramps by defining a hobo as &quot;an idle, shiftless, wandering
workman, ranking scarcely above the tramp.
&quot;I disagree. From the standpoint of morality and the benefits conferred
on Society, the hobo certainly outranks the tramp; but from the standpoint of
intelligence and resourcefulness, the average tramp ranks many degrees above
the average hobo.</p>

<p>
However, all
this is beside the point. I believe that the term &quot;hobo&quot; is derived
from the words &quot;Oh&quot; and &quot;Bo&quot;. When I was a tramp, the most
common and frequently used salutation among tramps was the term &quot;Bo&quot;.
It was also frequently used as an apellation as, for example, in &quot;Hello,
Bo, which way are you going?&quot; or &quot;Pass the whisky, will you,
Bo?&quot; Tramps rarely called each other by their known names or monickers.
When hailing a tramp from a short distance it was customary to prefix the term
&quot;Bo&quot; with &quot;Oh&quot;, as in &quot;Oh, Bo, don't forget the salt
and pepper&quot;.</p>

<p>
Probably the
most common occurence in which the terms were combined was when seeking a place
to doss at night. Most tramps travel in couples or small groups as a measure of
self-protection, and should one be ditched at night at any place that offered
cover, such as a string of empty box cars on a siding, he would try to locate companions
by stopping beside each boxcar door and calling &quot;Oh, Bo&quot;. He would
thus avoid the labor of climbing in and out of a number of cars, for it was the
custom of tramps to respond to the call in some manner.</p>
