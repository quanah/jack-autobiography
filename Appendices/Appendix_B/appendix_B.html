Comments by Jack's daughter, Alice Everson Weiss</p>

<p><b><A name="alice1" HREF="../../Chapter_1/chapter_1.html#alice1">
Page
2, last para.</A></b>Mother used to tell me
that at one time Grandpa Everson was Dean of Russ Medical [School]. Probably
untrue, as Jack undoubtedly would not have skipped over such a praiseworthy
background note --(or might he?) There seems to be, even this early in the
document, a derogatory attitude toward his father.</p>

<p>

4. </A></b>I was told that grandpa died of an aneurism (if at an early age, usually
the after-effect of syphilis- so my doctor told me). and that before his death,
he published a paper in a medical journal descring his symptoms in minute
detail, which brought him some kind or another of fame or recognition.</p>

<p>
<b><A name="alice3" HREF="../../Chapter_3/chapter_3.html#alice3">Page 11, first
para.</A></b> He seems to have &quot;visual&quot; [eidetic] memory as distinguished
from &quot;oral&quot; [verbal] memory. I recall in scenic fashion, but quickly
forget things heard.<BR><BR>
(I was surprised at his rather good writing, though
the contents so far are of interest mostly to himself or to closely related
persons).</p>

His descriptions of the varieties and methods of tramps and criminals [are]
quite interesting.</p>

4. </A></b>Vital information. One never knows when one may be able to use it, does
one?<BR><BR>
(I am beginning to wonder about now where fact leaves
off and fiction begins. Methinks papa read a bit of Jim Tully and sought to
emulate--could be? Also, post
WW-I, the publication called
&quot;Captain Billy's Whiz-Bang&quot; contained versification of &quot;Toledo
Slim&quot;, &quot;The Big Rock Candy Mountains&quot;, &quot;The Girl with the Blue
Velvet Band&quot;, etc., --to be read in those days in close secrecy).</p>

<p>Comment by WLE: I believe Jack had read Tully's book and thought rather
little of it, claiming that Tully didn't really know the world of trampdom.
And yes, I recall Captain B's W-B; by today's standars, it would be considered
mildly risque, at worst.  The songs Alice mentions have been collected and
published by all manner of folksong aficionados.

and General. </A></b>Minor note on tramp tricks:
White tramps approach negroes as a matter of profitable practice. The
flattery to the negro's ego usually results in a very generous handout. (This
picked up from a former boyfriend named, of all things, Jack, who had tramped
in pursuit of story material for about two years- funny? I knew nothing of
papa's tramp background but damn near followed in my mother's footsteps )
</p>

<p>(Comment by WLE: It appears Alice was temporarily confused about Jack's
earlier marriages and at this point didn't realize that there had been
<u><b>two</u></b> of them.)</p>

&quot;Don't

poet's effluvia&quot;, very effective description.</p>
<p>(Comment by WLE: to me, it's fairly obviously &quot;don't shit (piss?) on the
seat&quot;, but there's room here for creative imagination- e.g. &quot;here come my
two dogs.&quot)

Reminds me of the convent. Mother could not pay full
rates, so I had to work for part of my board money. In the laundry, Mondays;
darning the smaller kids' socks, Tuesdays (I was about 10); carrying trays to
the infirmary (they always arrived with one peach or one-half slice of
pineapple, altho [they] started with two) every meal; Wednesdays, back to the
laundry to work on the mangle; Thursdays, kitchen work (ate what the nuns had;
very good, too); Friday and Saturday, clean candlesticks etc. for the altar,
the pleasant smell of beeswax, the sour odor of vases too long filled with
flowers and unchanged water, their especially foul odor after a week of
chrysanthemums. Food: beans, tripe, liver, head cheese with the bristles still
on, ugh!, salt cod. Every Saturday morning, a dose of Epsom salts. March to
June, spring medicine, a dope made up from herbs, an oleaginous mixture
resembling automobile oil with green and tan tones in which floated wilted
forms of nauseous-looking vegetation. As to flogging, well beaten--had black
and blue marks on buttocks and legs for two months--for clapping my hands (but
softly) behind Sister's back when a &quot;day scholar&quot; thumbed his nose at
her and she caught me.</p>

was reciprocated. I still have the feeling that basically he was a
&quot;mamma's boy&quot;.</p>

if one can inherit sex (or webbed toes--who in the family has them besides my
son?), that one can inherit emotional reactive factors, mental trends.
Certainly nothing in my environment led me in these paths, unless, unless . . .
grandma's early influence. I don't know.</p>

where these two got together.</p>

1</A></b>. &quot;Ich maux nix aus &quot; - mother often used the phrase. She said
she learned it in the German-Jewish neighborhood in Chi where she lived as a
child. She did know many German and Yiddish phrases and songs.</p>

2: </A></b>Was this mamma? apparently not. I emphatically deny that I died 47 years
and 8 months ago, and mother did not die in a whorehouse-- at least, none that
I was running.</p>
<p>
So apparently this gal was #1 - oh yes, mother did
tell me that he had a wife before her who committed suicide and unless my
memory is very faulty, Millie told me the same thing.</p>

Para. 3.</A></b>Mother said that grandma
dreamed of this fire when it occurred. Whether grandma told her that in later
years, or whether my father and mother were then married, I cannot tell from
this part of the text. He mentioned leaving his wife after her baby was born
(page 42) but which wife, deponent sayeth not.
</p>

<p>(WLE: As I read the account, the wife mentioned on page 42 was his first
wife, not Alice's mother (Mary), and it is fairly clear that he left her
<u>before</u> the baby was born.)</p>

1.</A></b> I am amazed at the brevity with which he passes over four years. I'll
bet the brevity was because Millie would either see this or was typing it
for him. <BR>
(WLE: Millie was quite unhappy over the thought of publishing his MS., and
the thought that she might see it might well have influenced Jack's choice
of language.)<BR><BR>

<p>
<b>Final Comment.
</b>My apologies for questioning where fact left off and fiction began. While
much was omitted, I believe all that was contained was factual.</p>

<p>
<b><A name="alice40" HREF="../../odds_and_ends.html#alice40">Re the last
page: </A></b>It appears that somewhere, name unknown, there was still another of
the tribe.</p>

<p>
On the whole, I found it an extremely interesting
document, sections of which could possibly be incorporated into a group of
short stories, or used as the theme of a novel.</p>

<p>
The Puritan conscience amazes me. I find too little
humor, wry or otherwise, and too much of a certain pedantry of which I here
seem to be equally guilty,</p>

<p>
Final comment by WLE: I never met Mary (Alice's mother) and don't know what
her maiden name was.  I have the impression that Millie felt uneasy about both
Alice and Mary and discouraged any contact with or talk about them.
 Unfortunate, because I recall Alice as quite a real person.  I seem to recall
having seen her once since World War II, while living on Jayne Ave. in Oakland,
but can't be sure.  Somewhere about then, I lost contact.  I do recall her
saying she had discouraged her mother from attending Jack's funeral, fearing
that she (Mary) would have made quite a theatrical production out of the event.
