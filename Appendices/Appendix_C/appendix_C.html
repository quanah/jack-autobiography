This Appendix is
the catch-all, the repository of all the leftovers, the hall closet where things
are thrown until someone can decide what to do with them.</p>

<p>A
variety of clippings, photos, brief notes, scraps of paper, and what have you.
They are presented in the order listed here.</p>

<p>
First, the <A HREF="pictures/uncle.jpg">
gentleman</A> with the wrinkled coat, checkered vest, and impressive moustache. The
<A HREF="pictures/uncleback.jpg">back</A> of the photo reads, 
Presented

so, who is he? Not one of Carrie Jane's tribe. Not one of Jack's
brothers; they all died young. Not his father. Most likely his father's
brother, and Jack's uncle.</p>

<p>
Jack was a
joiner, of sorts. In my youth, I knew that he was a member of the Fraternal
Order of Eagles. Later, he became a Mason and was a member of the Sciots. With
the advent of radio he was a member of two groups which staged a weekly talk
show; first, the Lake Merritt Ducks, in which he held the office of Head
Scratcher, and later, the <A HREF="goats.html">Goat Island Goats</A>. Both were amusing for a time
but bogged down and disbanded, probably
because its one helluva job to keep producing new, interesting, and funny
material week after week. I have no documentation on the Ducks, but there is a
clipping dated Sept. 15, 1926, which announces the Goats' initial broadcast.
They lasted for at least a year.</p>

<p>
Jack never
gave up on his ability to write songs and music. Of a dozen or so, I have
selected <A HREF="dreams.html">&quot;Wonderful Dreams of You&quot;,</A> <A HREF="pictures/copyright.jpg">copyrighted</A> in 1942 as my choice
for the best of the lot. It never went anywhere, but you might like to try it
on your zither.</p>

<p>
There are <A HREF="jackassort.html">
assorted pictures of Jack</A>, taken at various times but unfortunately; lacking
dates.</p>

<p>
Then there
is an <A HREF="marriage.html">intriguing document,</A> handwritten
on a piece of scratch paper, which says that Jack and Millie were married
in the Methodist Episcopal Church in
San Rafael, Calif. in January 9, 1915.
I was born in 1908. Did Millie, that paragon of conventional respectability,
get carried away and enter into an unsanctioned liaison? Was I an illegitimate
child for my first six-plus years? I suspect that the truth of the matter is
more prosaic. Quite likely, they were indeed married in May of 1906 (Jack, p.
81);the original marriage license was destroyed in the <A HREF="pictures/paperburn.jpg">fire,</A> and in order to
have some sort of documentary evidence available they repeated the ceremony in
1915. Moreover, it was during World War I, Jack was in the <A HREF="jacks_license.html">Merchant Marine,</A> and
my brother John was to make his debut in a few months; these may have been
contributing factors.</p>

<p>
One last item, Jack's <A HREF="pictures/jackbusinesscard.jpg">business card.</a></p>

<p>
And now,
if you have stuck with the narrative all the way, you know a good deal (maybe
more than you wanted to know?) about my father and his life. I hope you found
his autobiography interesting.</p>

<p>
For those
interested in the technical details, this opus was produced on an old (but
souped-up) Macintosh SE. The type face used was Geneva 10-point, with other
fonts used here and there for variety. The original text was printed out on a
Hewlett-Packard Deskwriter and then reproduced on photocopy machines. The
floppy, along with originals of clippings, photos, etc. will be turned over to
whomever is willing to take custody of them.</p>
