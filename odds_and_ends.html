ODDS AND ENDS - LOOSE ENDS</b></p>

<P>
When I returned to Denver in October
of 1900 after the kidnapping affair at Pocatello there was still a soft spot in
my heart for Ella. Though I had no desire to see her again, I was curious to
know what had become of her. I made inquiries, and learned that she had married
the black-haired boy friend whom I had pummelled, within a month or two after
we split up. She had moved to North Denver, a
 locality I rarely visited, and it was not until sometime in 1903 or 1904
that I met her again as I came out of a department store. She was pushing a
baby carriage containing a pretty black-eyed little girl, whom I judged to be
about a year old, and by her side was a pleasant-faced chubby boy about four
years of age.</p>

<p>
To me, the meeting was embarrassing.
Why, I do not know. Ella's greeting was more than cordial, and her black eyes
sparkled. Motherhood did not seem to have changed her appearance in any way.
She told me the names of her two children, and after five minutes of inconsequential
chatter we shook hands again and parted, heading in opposite directions.</p>

<p>
I had not taken more than ten steps
away when, without apparent reason, I stopped and turned to look at her. She,
too, had stopped and was looking in my direction.  
She smiled, I waved to her, and then continued on in a reflective
mood, wondering about what might have been and the blue-eyed, curly-headed,
flaxen-haired little boy beside her. <A name="alice40" HREF="Appendices/Appendix_B/appendix_B.html#alice40">I wondered then, and I wonder now, if he
followed in his father's footsteps and became a tramp.</A> I hope not.</p>
